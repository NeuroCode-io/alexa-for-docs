Shaw, Visiting Professor, University of Massachusetts Boston, USA and Emeritus Professor, University of London, UKThe global political economy is in flux as a series of cumulative crises impacts its organization and governance. The IPE series has tracked its development in both analysis and structure over the last three decades. It has always had a concentra-tion on the global South. Now the South increasingly challenges the North as the centre  of  development,  also  reflected  in  a  growing  number  of  submissions  and  publications on indebted Eurozone economies in Southern Europe.An  indispensable  resource  for  scholars  and  researchers,  the  series  examines  a  variety  of  capitalisms  and  connections  by  focusing  on  emerging  economies,  companies and sectors, debates and policies. It informs diverse policy communi-ties as the established trans-Atlantic North declines and ‘the rest’, especially the BRICS, rise.Titles include:Eirikur BergmannICELAND AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CRISISBoom, Bust and RecoveryYildiz Atasoy (editor)GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THE POLITICS OF DIVERSITYGabriel Siles-BrüggeCONSTRUCTING EUROPEAN UNION TRADE POLICYA Global Idea of EuropeJewellord Singh and France Bourgouin (editors)RESOURCE  GOVERNANCE  AND  DEVELOPMENTAL  STATES  IN  THE  GLOBAL  SOUTHCritical International Political Economy PerspectivesTan Tai Yong and Md Mizanur Rahman (editors)DIASPORA ENGAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH ASIALeila Simona Talani, Alexander Clarkson and Ramon Pachedo Pardo (editors)DIRTY CITIESTowards a Political Economy of the Underground in Global CitiesMatthew Louis BishopTHE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENTXiaoming Huang (editor)MODERN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN JAPAN AND CHINADevelopmentalism, Capitalism and the World Economic SystemBonnie K.

It was simultaneously a crisis in capitalism and a crisis of national identity – later simply referred to as  The Crash . I was amongst many  others  involved  in  thinking  through  questions  of  the  Icelandic  crisis and its recovery, in both an economic and a political dimension. After  I  had  published  a  few  pieces  in  the  British    Guardian   my  office  was flooded with foreign journalists, many of whom had preconceived ideas about the events in Iceland. It was difficult not to engage in this unprecedented situation. I was, for example, among the founders of the so-called    InDefence   group  established  in  mid-October  2008  to  protest  against the British government’s implementation of anti-terrorist legis-lation to freeze Icelandic assets in the UK. In 2011 I served on Iceland’s elected  Constitutional  Council,  which  had  the  task  of  drafting  a  new  constitution  for  the  young  republic.  I  have  endeavoured  not  to  allow  this and other involvements to cloud my judgement when writing this book. In fact, I believe that these experiences have provided me with a good, perhaps even a unique, perspective on explaining the crisis to a wider audience and warning other nations of some of the mistakes that were made prior to, during and after the crisis, which should serve as a lesson to them.  Though I am solely responsible for its content, many have influenced the writing of this book. First I would like to thank my collaborators in the  Imagined Recovery  Project, Dr Claes Belfrage at Liverpool University and  Dr  David  Berry  at  the  University  of  Sussex.  Some  of  the  concepts  used  and  phrases  found  in  the  text,  mainly  in  Chapter  2,  were  devel-oped within the project. Our continuous discussions during the past few years not only allowed me to clarify my thinking on events surrounding The  Crash  but  also  opened  my  eyes  to  many  new  avenues  explored  further  in  this  book.  Some  of  the  thinking  concerning  the  impact  of  post-colonialism, mainly explored in Chapter 1, was initially developed for  a  project  analysing  microstates  on  the  periphery  of  Europe,  led  by  Drs Rebecca Adler-Nissen and Ulrik Pram Gad at Copenhagen University. Chapter  3  contains  information  relating  to  Iceland’s  foreign  relations  that I developed for a project, now under the heading of  Distant Voices , ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":11,"content":"Preface xifirst led by Professor Claudia Ramos at the Fernando Pessoa University in Portugal and later by Dr Lise Rye at NTNU in Norway.  I  would  also  specially  like  to  thank  two  of  my  colleagues  at  Bifröst  University,  Drs  Magnús  Árni  Magnússon  and  Njörður  Sigurjónsson,  with  whom  I  share  an  office,  for  fruitful  discussions  throughout  the  writing process. The text has also benefited from the constructive criti-cism  of  anonymous  reviewers  and  from  various  readers,  who  also  will  remain  anonymous.  Palgrave  Macmillan’s  editors  and  staff  have  been  stimulating to work with. I would specially like to thank editor of the International Political Economy Series, Professor Timothy Shaw, for his relentless encouragement and insightful comments, as well as Christina Brian and Amanda McGrath for all their support throughout the process. I also thank the Association of Icelandic Non-Fiction Writers,  Hagþenkir , for its important support.  Last, and perhaps most importantly, I would like to thank my friends and  family  for  tolerating  me  during  some  of  the  more  trying  periods  of  the  drafting  of  the  book.  Special  thanks  are  due  to  my  partner  in  life,  Aino  Freyja  Järvelä,  and  to  our  children,  Sólrún  Rós  Eiríksdóttir,  Einar  Sigurður  Eiríksson,  Hrafnhildur  Eiríksdóttir  and  Ægir  Bergmann  Eiríksson – to whom this book is dedicated.

The tiny Nordic country was reported as being a rogue state defaulting on its obligations. In the years leading up to the Crash, Iceland  had  been  trumpeted  in  world  business  media  as  an  economic  miracle.  Its  new  breed  of  Viking  Capitalists  had  become  rock  stars  of  the  global  finance-driven  economy.  Now  their  action  was  testing  the  very foundations of Europe’s financial system. A domino effect threat-ened. Half a decade later, Iceland was, however, already well on the road to  recovery,  with  greater  growth  and  less  unemployment  than  most  European states.  This was a financial tsunami without precedent. Iceland also responded significantly differently to the troubles than most other states, allowing its  financial  system  to  default  rather  than  throwing  good  money  after  bad. In addition, the left-wing government, parachuted in on the canopy of  the  so-called  Pots  and  Pans  revolution,  refused  to  implement  strict  austerity.  The  Icelandic  case  thus  provides  interesting  lessons  for  the  wider world. In this book I will explain the exceptional case of Iceland’s fantastical boom, bust and relatively rapid recovery after the Crash. I will provide a clear introduction to the particular case of Iceland both histor-ically and financially, and explain the lessons for the wider EU crisis and for over-reaching economies that over-rely on financial markets.  The  Crash  illustrated  an  inherited  vulnerability  in  the  economy,  deeply rooted in the very smallness the Viking  outvasion  was meant to cure.  Cooper  and  Shaw  (2009)  maintain  that  Iceland  provides  a  perti-nent example of a small state where vulnerability and resilience became      Introduction – Boom, Bust and Recovery   ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":15,"content":"2   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisclosely intertwined; that its unconventional financial behaviour brought short-term  gains  but  also  exposed  us  to  massive  long-term  problems.  These are among some of the characteristics of the Icelandic economy I will explore in this book.  There were a lot of misconceptions about the Icelandic crisis. The then British  Prime  Minister  Gordon  Brown,  for  example,  announced  to  the  world on live TV that Iceland was bankrupt, had defaulted on its sover-eign debt and was in effect a failed state. Radical forces in southern Europe, on  the  other  hand,  told  a  glorifying  story  of  militant  Icelandic  revolu-tionaries  taking  to  the  streets  and  overthrowing  a  corrupt  government  before  categorically  refusing  to  pay  the  bankers’  debts.  In  many  articles  the Spanish daily  El     Pais  told a tale of the triumphant proletariat taking power, ousting the elite and then writing its own constitution. In Britain the    Guardian   wrote  about  a  feminist  revolution:  women  cleaning  the  house after the boys had wrecked the place in mad partying. In America the    New  York  Times   claimed  that  Iceland  was  the  first  to  prosecute  and  punish its politicians. In his book  Boomerang  Michael Lewis talked about an  angry  mob  roaming  the  streets  of  Reykjavik  blowing  up  the  Viking  Capitalists’ luxury cars. After the 2013 parliamentary election the world media, on the other hand, wrongly reported that the old guard was back in power. There seemed to be endless myths about the crisis and the great Icelandic revolution, which I will in this book try to unravel and correct.    The Crash  It was all very dramatic. Clearly something was going very wrong. The global banking giant Lehman Brothers had recently gone into adminis-tration in America, sending a shockwave throughout the international financial system. Our government had been travelling the world desper-ately shopping for money to bail out out the overblown financial system, which had grown way out of control in the preceding years – amounting to  almost  ten  times  the  country’s  GDP.  But  there  were  no  takers.  No  one was willing to give us more cash. Not even our Nordic neighbours. When we came begging they told us rather to go to the IMF. At first our government felt that to do so would be humiliating, implying that we had failed in our historical quest to be recognized by our neighbours as an independent and fully functioning modern nation state – which is the core of Iceland’s national postcolonial identity. Our leaders seemed to think that the IMF was only for failed third-world countries. Instead we  sent  representatives  to  Moscow  to  squeeze  some  money  out  of  the  Russians – or rather to put pressure on the West to step in. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":16,"content":"Introduction – Boom, Bust and Recovery 3 This, however, contradicted all traditional alliances. Since independ-ence  in  1944,  Iceland  has  been  committed  to  Western  co-operation,  both as a founding member of NATO in 1949 and as a participant in the EU Internal Market after entering into the European Economic Area in 1994. We are also a fully participating member of the EU border control scheme,  Schengen.  Our  strongest  allies  have  always  been  the  Nordic  states,  the  UK,  the  rest  of  Western  Europe  and,  for  a  while,  America.  There was a US military base here until just two years prior to the Crash. Iceland’s self-image emphasizes independence but is also tied to Western Europe: we like to think of ourselves as the small Atlantic state that links Europe and America. So it really was a major psychological U-turn for most  Icelanders  to  suddenly  turn  to  the  East  for  help  –  all  the  way  to  Moscow,  of  all  places!  To  make  matters  worse,  our  delegates  returned  empty handed from Russia.  Running  out  of  time,  Iceland  found  itself  without  friends  in  the  world. Apart from our tiny neighbour, the Faroe Islands, who sent over enough for us to buy a few vital necessities, no one stepped up to help us. However, this lack of loan opportunities later proved to be a blessing in disguise, as I will explain.  On  Monday  6  October  2008  Prime  Minister  Geir  Haarde  addressed  the nation on television. Apart from the traditional annual New Year’s Eve address, this is something our PM never does. We were all watching, gathered round TV sets and computer screens in our workplace, in cafés and at home on that misty afternoon. It was not just that this sophis-ticated  and  usually  perfectly  composed  man  seemed  shaken  but  that  he  concluded  his  unique  address  by  asking  God  to  bless  Iceland.  This  is  when  we  knew  we  were  in  serious  trouble.  Iceland  is  quite  secular.  Unlike American politicians, Icelandic politicians never refer to God in public – at least not without cracking a joke.  Before dawn the following morning our first bank fell, the second on the day after that. Then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown invoked the UK Anti-Terrorism Act (passed after ‘9/11’ in 2001) to freeze all Icelandic assets in the UK. That act killed of our last and largest bank still standing, Kaupthing. This had devastating consequences not only for the whole Icelandic economy, but also for the hundreds of thousands of UK citizens who had entrusted our banks with their savings. In only three days all of the Iceland’s three international banks, amounting to 85 per cent of the country’s financial system, came tumbling down one after the other; first Landsbanki, then Glitnir and finally Kaupthing – after our Central Bank had just handed Kaupthing the rest of our foreign currency reserve in  a  desperate  attempt  to  save  our  last  financial  institution.  Iceland  is  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":17,"content":"4   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisone of the smallest countries in the world and borders on being a micro-state with just over 300,000 inhabitants. However, this experience ranks third in the history of the world’s greatest bankruptcies (Halldórsson & Zoega, 2010).  At  a  stroke,  the  stock  exchange  and  the  entire  equity  market  was  virtually  wiped  out,  the  tiny  currency,  the  Icelandic  króna,  tanked,  spurring rampant inflation, which in the following weeks and months ate up most people’s savings, property values dropped by more than a third  and  unemployment  reached  levels  never  seen  before  in  the  life  of  the  young  republic.  We  didn’t  know  what  to  do.  Most  remained  paralysed,  some  took  to  the  streets  in  angry  protest  while  a  few  more  constructively minded people instantly formed new associations aimed to  resurrect  and  reform  the  stricken  nation.  Bailing  out  the  domestic  operations  of  the  banks  alone  caused  the  national  debt  to  shoot  from  23 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 78 per cent in 2009 (Central Bank of Iceland, 2010).  The  addition  of  other  costs  brought  the  debt  level  to  well  over  100 per cent of GDP.  Iceland had few good options. The IMF would not consider our loan application  until  we  had  settled  our  dispute  with  the  UK  and  Dutch  governments  over  the  Icesave  deposits  accounts,  which  the  fallen  Landsbanki had set up in those countries, leaving many of their citizens without access to their money. Even though our government steadfastly argued that we weren’t legally at fault and that the nation would fulfil all  its  legal  obligations  regarding  Icesave,  the  IMF  wouldn’t  budge.  It  was being pressured by the UK and Dutch governments, backed by the whole EU apparatus. This was a staring contest we could not afford to drag out.  In the Western media Iceland was reported as being a failed state: our government had defaulted on its legal obligations, and we were virtually doomed  –  falling  into  an  economic  ‘abyss’  with  all  imports  ‘blocked’.  (An  illuminating  example  of  the  fall  from  grace  came  in  the  midst  of  the havoc when the Japanese unilaterally and without any explanation cancelled a planned concert tour of the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra in  Tokyo  and  other  Japanese  cities.)  As  I  will  discuss  in  the  following  chapter, being recognized as a partner in Western culture speaks to the inner core of Iceland’s postcolonial national identity. This misreporting thus hurt our self-image. Many friends abroad called asking if we were OK,  if  we  still  had  food  and  shelter.  They  sounded  convinced  that  we  had  all  lost  our  jobs,  and  offered  to  help.  This  was,  however,  not  the  case. Despite what was written in the world’s tabloids, we still went to work every day, received our salaries, paid our bills and gathered in the ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":18,"content":"Introduction – Boom, Bust and Recovery 5pubs in the evenings. Finally, the IMF came through with a loan package and a programme backed by our Nordic neighbours and Poland. As I will explain, the dispute over Icesave soon contributed in a dramatic way to Iceland’s  postcolonial  identity.  Fuelled  by  harsh  nationalistic  rhetoric  the  dispute  subsequently  turned  into  the  most  serious  international  conflict  Iceland  had  entered  into  since  the  Cod  Wars  with  the  British  in the 1970s.  Iceland’s reputation abroad was in tatters. We were caught in a perfect media storm, with disaster stories blazing across the world. In an article titled ‘Iceland’s next saga: The wounded tiger’s tale’ th e    Globe and   Mail , for example, dramatically reported a ‘sudden spasm of depopulation as Icelanders prepare to flee’ (Hart, 2008). Even the very name of the country gained specific connotations, linked with crisis, bankers’ excess, reckless business  dealings  and  economic  disaster.  Iceland’s  economic  collapse  was unprecedented. Leaders in crisis-ridden countries kept insisting that whatever problem they might face in these troubled times, at least they were  not  as  bad  as  Iceland.  Others  thought  that  Iceland  was  only  the  canary  in  the  coalmine;  that  more  countries  were  on  the  same  trajec-tory to economic devastation. The  Guardian ’s David Teather wrote that Iceland was ‘seen as a warning for the rest of the world’ (Teather, 2008). In Ireland a popular joke asked, ‘What is the difference between Ireland and Iceland?’ Answer: ‘One letter and six months.’ Another joke asked, ‘What is the Capital of Iceland?’ Answer: ‘About five euros.’ Similarly, in the UK, the  Financial Times  wrote about  Reykjavik-on-  Thames  (Murphy, 2008a). Furthermore, independence movements in neighbouring states like Scotland lost a role model.  Iceland  and  Ireland  provide  an  interesting  comparison.  Both  devel-oped relatively late in the 20th century and both grew an unsustainable financial sector around the turn of the century, which had over-extended itself and would burst with devastating effect. The Irish banks loaned far too much to property developers, provoking a massive housing bubble, while Iceland’s expansion abroad grew unsustainable and drawing back high  risk  capital  against  high  interest.  Economist  and  Nobel  laureate  Paul Krugman demonstrates that both countries had run into a bind by being just like the US, ‘only more so’ – both had ‘jumped with both feet into  the  brave  new  world  of  unsupervised  global  markets’  (Krugman,  2009). The two countries were, however, on each side of the EU fence, which  might  have  determined  their  very  different  responses:  Ireland  bailing  out  banks  and  providing  a  blanket  guarantee  for  all  liabilities  while the Icelandic banks were taken into administration.

Our  usually  calm  and  sleepily  safe  society  was  ripped  apart  in  internal  conflict.  The  left-wing  opposition  blamed  the  neolib-eral  establishment,  including  the  Central  Bank;  the  governor  of  the  Central  Bank  blamed  the  risk-seeking  bankers;  the  bankers  blamed  the government; and the Prime Minister attributed the whole dreadful sequence of events to external forces, mainly the international Credit Crunch. This lack of any sense of responsibility angered the public to the extent that they took to the streets in greater numbers than ever before.  At  the  turn  of  the  century,  Iceland’s  three  main  sectoral  banks  had  been privatized and each passed into the ownership of a nouveau-rich clan.  By  vigorously  enforcing  its  deregulation  policy  the  laissez-faire  government  had  created  a  monster  it  couldn’t  control:  the  Icelandic  Viking Capitalist was born. In an effort to gain international recognition the new Icelandic business Vikings headed for the high streets around Europe with their pockets full of borrowed money – literally storming the global financial market with the savings of generations of hard-working Icelanders. It seemed that Iceland’s historical journey towards modernity was  finally  complete.  The  new  business  elite  were  heroically  branded  outvasion Vikings ( Útrásarvíkingur ), referring to Iceland’s Golden Age of the  settlement  society  in  the  9th  and  10th  centuries,  when  Icelanders  were still free, before falling prey to foreign oppression.  In linking the new outvasion Vikings with this particular memory of the  past,  based  on  a  collective  myth  created  during  Iceland’s  struggle  for  independence  from  Denmark  in  the  19th  century,  the  discourse  on  the  economic  boom  was  framed  and  explained  through  collective  nationalistic sentiments, which spoke directly to the people’s postcolo-nial political identity. I maintain that the enthusiastic behaviour of the outvasion Vikings and the widespread, almost cheerleading acceptance of their endeavours at home must be explained in relation to Iceland’s history  and  through  its  postcolonial  national  identity.  This  is  similar  to, for example, what Foukas and Dimoulas claim is true of the crisis in Greece: that a historical and geopolitical analysis is vital to understand economic  developments  (Foukas  &  Dimoulas,  2013).  Linking  acqui-sitions  of  foreign  companies  with  the  masculine  image  of  the  Viking  explorers  implied  that  the  Icelandic  businessmen  had  unique  natural  characteristics, which helped them get ahead in international business. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":20,"content":"Introduction – Boom, Bust and Recovery 7The  extensive  growth  of  the  economy  was  thus  in  a  way  intertwined  with a notion of a starting point of a new area for Iceland.  Many  seemingly  irresponsible  actions  of  the  business  Vikings  were  legitimized and made sense of through this nationalistic discourse. The Viking heritage is aggressive and masculine. Accordingly it was in a kind of a testosterone-driven pissing contest that Icelandic CEOs, fresh out of business school, took over established companies in fields they couldn’t even pronounce. The fast decision-making and risk-seeking behaviour of this new breed was celebrated by our President as well as in the business media around the world, boosting the already overblown egos of these young  alpha-males.  Within  one  short  decade  this  traditional  Nordic  welfare state economy was transferred into one of deregulated bonanza capitalism. This occurred also without much criticism in the academic debate, which rather welcomed the change.  When  the  clouds  started  to  gather  on  the  horizon  in  early  2006,  all  criticism  against  what  we  had  grown  accustomed  to  calling  the   Icelandic   economic  miracle   was  dismissed  as  ill-intentioned  whining  by  envious  foreigners,  as  it  violated  our  established  postcolonial  self-image. Any voice of caution and classical wisdom was thus dismissed as old-fashioned. In an opinion-oppressed political environment the regu-lation  industry,  for  example,  was  mocked  by  politicians  and  the  busi-ness elite alike. Throwing nationalism into the mix of inexperience, the Icelandic  government  responded  to  foreign  criticism  to  the  poor  state  of our economy by launching a defensive PR campaign in London, New York  and  Copenhagen.  Then  came  The  Crash.  Russian-style  privatiza-tion and rapid deregulation had led to exponential growth of the finan-cial sector. Fuelled by nationalistic rhetoric Iceland had gone in less than a  decade  from  a  resource-based  local  economy,  dependent  on  fishing  and geo-thermal energy, to a global financial giant.  When  the  dust  had  settled  we  saw  that  it  was  an  evil  mix  of  greed,  incompetence,  nepotism,  nationalism,  youthful  risk  addiction  and  a  kind of collective superiority complex which had led to the fall of the whole  Icelandic  financial  sector  in  October  2008.  As  I  will  explain  in  the following chapter, this development can perhaps best be explained through postcolonial analysis.    The Pots and Pans revolution  The  across  the  centre  government,  led  by  the  hegemonic  right-wing  Independence Party (IP) in coalition with the junior Social Democratic Alliance  (SDA),  was  ousted  in  a  series  of  largely  non-violent  popular  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":21,"content":"8   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisprotests  in  January  2009,  which  is  most  commonly  referred  to  as  the   Pots and   Pans   revolution  ( Búsáhaldabyltingin ). It was the first government to  collapse  after  the  international  financial  crisis  hit.  Peaceful  protests  had started in October 2008. Frustration grew, first with the lack of any sense of responsibility, then with the lack of effective action to ease the perceived  economic  pain  most  people  felt,  and  finally  with  the  sense  that all the political elite were incompetent. Its failure to meet foreign pressure forcefully enough in the Icesave dispute added to this notion of incompetence.  Initially  the  government  tried  to  dismiss  the  protesters  as  frustrated  wannabe  politicians  and  disillusioned  youngsters  who  did  not  under-stand  the  complexity  of  the  situation.  But  when  our  grandmothers  put  down  their  knitting  needles,  strapped  their  boots  on  and  took  to  the streets shouting for an election we saw that the disgust was almost universal.  Without  much  organization  or  central  planning  the  public  surrounded the Parliament building when it resumed after the Christmas recess on 20 January. The protestors put forward a clear demand for an early election. Ignoring them, the ministers and parliamentarians tried to sit out the protest, hiding inside the old building in central Reykjavik. This time it didn’t work. The protests grew and the people kept warm by burning torches in front of the building. They were going nowhere. The Parliament remained under siege well into this dark night in Iceland’s history, and the vigil resumed the following morning.  This was the first time in Icelandic history that a young anarchist might have  expected  to  meet  his  grandmother  in  the  crowd  demonstrating  against the government and drumming with her kitchen knife on pots and  pans.  The  Icelandic  public  feared  that  their  country  had  virtually  been stolen by a globetrotting business elite that had spent more time rubbing  shoulders  with  international  high  society  than  giving  back  to the society that had enabled them to enjoy this privileged lifestyle. Ashamed  at  having  allowed  this  monstrous  Viking  business  culture  to  grow beyond control, ordinary Icelanders were determined to take their country back.  We  now  understand  that  the  Icelandic  finance-dominated  growth  model collapsed under its own weight. Perhaps much as in Ireland. As Pedar Kirby (2010: 4) explains, though Ireland’s recession surely mirrors external developments, the particular causes of its crisis were ‘decisively local in origin’ as the economy had grown unsustainable. The same is true of Iceland, as I will explain in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 in Part II. In the following chapter I will offer an additional explanation and demonstrate how the constitution of Iceland’s postcolonial national identity, which ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":22,"content":"Introduction – Boom, Bust and Recovery 9emphasizes  formal  self-authority  as  well  as  a  desire  to  be  recognized  as a partner in Western culture, prevented us from acknowledging the systemic faults in the set-up of our economic and political structure. Here is another interesting parallel with Ireland, which, having belonged to the UK, was keen on demonstrating its new-found economic prosperity in  order  to  emphasize  its  independence  (Fagan,  2003).  Furthermore,  both were gripped by fear of the grim days of the past returning.  On 1 February 2009 the ousted government was replaced by a fragile left-wing  caretaker  government  led  by  the  SDA  in  coalition  with  the  Left  Green  Movement  (LGM),  which  leans  much  further  to  the  left.  This was a minority government backed by a new leadership within the Progressive Party (PP), which had until 2007 served as junior partner in coalitions with the IP. A well known activist for social reform, the Social Affairs  minister  Jóhanna  Sigurðardóttir,  who  had  belonged  to  the  far  left  of  the  SDA,  became  Iceland’s  first  female  Prime  Minister  (and  the  first  openly  gay  PM  in  the  world).  The  government  promised  to  clean  up its act and abandon corrupt practices with a more professional and transparent decision-making process. Subsequently, the three politically appointed governors of the Central Bank were replaced by a single profes-sional governor (Már Guðmundsson, who nevertheless had affiliations with the SDA) and the director and board of the Financial Supervisory Authority were sacked. After gaining a majority in the following parlia-mentary  elections,  in  spring  2009,  the  new  government  initiated  a  number  of  policies  and  programmes  aimed  at  replacing  the  collapsed  neoliberal growth model with a resurrected Nordic welfare society. The election  results  showed  a  massive  swing  to  the  left.  For  the  first  time  in the young republic’s history, a pure left-wing majority coalition was formed. Many interpreted the result as a powerful shift away from the Viking Capitalism that appeared to have left the country in economic ruin. Four years later the pendulum shifted back in the April 2013 parlia-ment election, resulting in right of centre government resuming power again, as I discuss further.  Instead  of  implementing  strict  austerity,  the  left-wing  post  crisis  government responded to The Crash with more broad-based measures aimed  at  protecting  the  welfare  and  purchasing  power  of  the  lower  income  groups,  thus  phasing  in  fiscal  consolidation  over  a  number  of  years  with  borrowing  from  abroad  and  raising  taxes  as  well  as  cutting  spending.  The  Nobel  Prize-winning  economist  Joseph  Stiglitz  has  claimed  that  economic  inequality  was  stifling  economic  recovery  in  the  US.  His  main  argument  is  that  the  middle  class  had  become  ‘too  weak to support the consumer spending that has historically driven our ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":23,"content":"10   Iceland and the International Financial Crisiseconomic growth’ (Stiglitz, 2013). Paul Krugman disputed the claim as unfounded. While agreeing that inequality was politically unfortunate, he  added:  ‘economics  is  not  a  morality  play’  (Krugman,  2013).  This  debate between the two American Nobel Prize-winning economists over the impact of inequality on recovery is interesting for the Icelandic case as  the  main  effort  of  the  left-wing  government  was  indeed  to  prevent  inequality growing with the progressing crisis.    Recovery and new critical order  The Crash was followed by a severe economic, social and political crisis. Key  government  institutions  and  the  political  class  stood  accused  of  having sponsored the economic rise and collapse. However devastating, this collapse also provided opportunities, as crisis in capitalism can open up our imagination to alternative ‘economic imaginaries’ (Jessop, 2004). The  constitutional  revision  process  was,  for  example,  an  integral  part  of the ‘imagined recovery’ of Iceland from this profound crisis. Indeed, the crisis did open up the public debate, with a flood of suggestions for recovery measures pouring through almost all outlets for public discus-sion; in the media, in open forum meetings and on the internet. New associations were being formed that challenged the ruling class and the whole political system. Serious discussions followed on creating a new Icelandic  republic,  French  style  –  in  data-science  lingo,  updating  the  system to Iceland 2.0.  Among major government initiatives was the imposition of tougher regulations   on   the   financial   industry.   The   new   office   of   Special   Prosecutor was established to investigate criminal activities in the finan-cial sector leading up to The Crash, and Parliament appointed a Special Investigation Research Commission (a ‘truth committee’), which was to analyse  events  and  eventually  proposed  to  Parliament  that  a  hitherto  dormant clause in the constitution relating to the prosecution of govern-ment ministers should be used to hold political leaders accountable. The former  Prime  Minister  was  indeed  prosecuted  before  this  special  court  and  sentenced  to  punishment.  But  as  I  will  explain,  this  was  in  effect  only a slap on the wrist; he never saw a jail cell. The fact that his polit-ical opponents singled out only Haarde for trial further undermined the whole exercise.  An agreement was struck with the UK and Dutch governments with regard to the Icesave deposit accounts. This was mainly so that Iceland could regain access to international financial markets and to allow the IMF  to  be  brought  in  to  stabilize  the  economy,  not  least  through  the  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":24,"content":"Introduction – Boom, Bust and Recovery 11introduction  of  capital  controls  and  the  co-funding  of  a  loan  package  with  the  Nordic  and  Polish  governments.  The  agreement,  however,  proved a hard sell to the general public. In an extraordinary move the President refused to pass the bill, referring it to a referendum, in which it was rejected by a large majority, spurring one of the greatest interna-tional disputes Iceland had ever fought. In early 2013, the EFTA Court ruled  on  the  case,  vindicating  Iceland  of  wrongdoing  and  dismissing  the claim of the British and Dutch authorities, which, with the backing of  the  EU,  had  insisted  that  Iceland  was  responsible  for  the  Icesave  deposits. After the ruling Iceland’s relationship with the outside world normalized again.  Iceland  is  the  smallest  currency  area  in  world.  An  application  for  EU  membership  was  made  in  order  to  create  a  more  stable  framework  around the economy together with the aim of fast-tracking the country into the Eurozone as a way out of currency controls and to gain access to a credible currency. Soon after the initial shock had died down, the accession  negotiation  process  foundered  on  the  rocks  of  nationalistic  rhetoric,  resulting  in  widespread  opposition  to  membership,  even  beyond previous levels. After the spring 2013 election, the new right of centre government, led by the PP, decided to freeze the negotiations.  Together  with  a  complete  overhaul  of  the  Constitution  these  previ-ously  mentioned  measures  were  instigated  to  not  only  resurrect  but  rather to establish a reformed base of the Icelandic society and marked a paradigm shift from the collapsed neoliberal model. In addition to these major governmental initiatives the whole party system, which tradition-ally consisted of four main political parties, was challenged by emerging political parties and an ever-increasing pressure to renew the leadership of the established ones. Symbolic of this was the election of a comedian, Jón Gnarr, as Mayor of Reykjavik.  Interestingly, all of these initiatives, both the ones instigated by the government and those emerging from grassroots measures, were subse-quently highly politicized in a radical ‘new critical order’ emerging from the crisis, contesting most initiatives for what constitutes ‘recovery’. The emergence of ‘critical orders’ following crises is not unusual historically, but the existence of a sustained one in which imagined recoveries can take form and stabilize in an advanced capitalist economy is. By stud-ying the process of these previously mentioned proposed reforms I will analyse this critical order, which has lodged deeply on the micro level of Icelandic everyday life and is in direct opposition to reparative moves.  Half a decade after The Crash, most economic indicators pointed to the  rapid  recovery  of  Iceland’s  economy,  perhaps  supporting  Stiglitz’s  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":25,"content":"12   Iceland and the International Financial Crisiscontention  mentioned  above.  The  currency  had  stabilized,  though  it  was  still  locked  behind  capital  controls;  GDP  was  growing  again  and  predicted soon to be up to its pre-crisis level; unemployment was amongst the lowest in Europe, below 5 per cent; and perhaps most importantly, opinion polls indicated as early as 2010 that Icelanders were becoming more  positive  in  their  economic  outlook  (Conway,  2010).  Still,  and  despite  the  benefits  of  its  longstanding  opposition  to  the  previously  hegemonic Independence Party, delegitimizing a capitalist ‘rise from the ruins’  proved  a  hard  sell  for  the  post-crisis  left-wing  coalition  govern-ment,  which  lost  heavily  in  the  spring  2013  parliamentary  elections,  when the IP and PP again won the majority they had so often enjoyed in the pre-crisis period. PP leader Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, whose popularity had risen during the campaign against the agreements with the  British  and  the  Dutch  on  Icesave,  replaced  Sigurðardóttir  as  Prime  Minister. The failure of the challenger, Þóra Arnórsdóttir, who had stood against President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson in the 2012 presidential elec-tion, running on a ticket marking the end of crisis politics and a renewed unification of Icelanders, was another example of a rejected proposal for reform.    Outline and analysis  This  book  tells  the  story  of  Iceland’s  incredible  boom  and  bust  and  provides a distinction between the  imagined  and  real  recovery after The Crash. Its principal novelty is to apply postcolonial analysis, which more is commonly used to explain cultural and political identities and their effect on bilateral foreign relations in newly independent states, on the development of Iceland’s economy leading up to The Crash. The same model can also help to explain Iceland’s response to external forces in its aftermath as well as the efforts towards recovery and indeed recog-nition  abroad.  This  approach  fits  into  Critical  International  Political  Economy,  which  departs  from  orthodox  IPE  (with  its  emphasis  on  empirical research) by applying ontological enquiry to historical evolu-tion (Shields, Bruff & Macartney, 2011).  The  book  is  structured  into  nine  chapters  in  three  parts  in  addi-tion  to  this  introduction  and  final  conclusions.  I  start  the  analysis  by  framing my postcolonial theoretical model within critical IPE, based on a post-structural approach. Through it I explain Iceland’s political and economic history and analyse its national identity emerging out of the independence struggle in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Icelandic politics were subsequently  dominated  by  a  nationalistic  discourse,  which  later  was  the  driving  force  behind  the  Viking-like  endeavours  of  Icelandic  busi-nessmen in Western Europe.  In Chapter 2 I provide an overview of the country’s economic history, which  is  marked  by  repeated  cycles  of  boom  and  bust.  In  the  20th  century, Iceland moved from being amongst the poorest economies and most backward societies in Europe to becoming one of the most modern and  prosperous  in  the  world.  Access  to  investment  during  and  in  the  wake  of  WWII  allowed  the  rapid  growth  of  a  resource-based  economy  around fishing and geo-thermal energy, until the creation of the finance-based Viking economy towards the end of the millennium.  Chapter 3 deals with Iceland’s foreign relations, which are linked with its economic development and also dictated by its postcolonial national identity. This has, for example, resulted in Iceland’s peculiar position in European integration, insofar as it participates in the EU Single Market through  the  EEA  without  being  a  formal  member  of  the  EU.  In  this  chapter  I  explain  Iceland’s  often  strained  relationship  with  its  neigh-bours, which can be traced to its postcolonial identity.  These  three  background  chapters  in  Part  I,  titled  ‘Rise  and  Shine’,  provide  a  basis  for  an  understanding  of  the  boom  and  bust  of  the  Icelandic economy after the turn of the millennium, which I will turn to next. In Part II, titled ‘Boom and Bust’, also divided into three chapters, I analyse the rise of the so-called Icelandic economic miracle and explain its dramatic downfall.  Chapter  4  discusses  the  emergence  of  Iceland’s  neoliberal,  finance-driven  economy,  which  was  taking  shape  around  the  turn  of  the  century. I map the widespread outvasion of the Viking Capitalists, when Iceland  was  hailed  as  an  economic  miracle  by  the  world’s  media,  and  explain how the incredible boom of the finance-driven Viking Capitalist economy was fuelled by a deeply rooted nationalistic rhetoric.  By 2006 we were living on borrowed time, as discussed in Chapter 5, which  deals  with  the  so-called  Geyser  Crisis  and  the  build-up  to  the  banking  crash  of  October  2008.  After  a  near-death  experience  in  the  mini crisis of 2006, the Icelandic Viking Capitalists threw off all chains and blew even more hot air into the economy – until finally falling off the financial cliff. Liquidity dried up abroad and Iceland was pushed out of international financial markets.  The Crash of 2008 not only destroyed Iceland’s economic well-being but also brought with it a profound crisis of identity. While navigating ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":27,"content":"14   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisthrough  extraordinary  turmoil  on  international  markets,  Iceland  was  also fending off hostile action by the British authorities. External forces thus significantly contributed to the level of crisis. Still, Iceland’s finance-driven economy collapsed under its own weight. In Chapter 6 I discuss the catastrophic events of October 2008.  In  Part  III,  headed  ‘Revolution  and  Recovery’,  I  explain  the  events  surrounding   the   Pots   and   Pans   revolution   and   analyse   Iceland’s   economic recovery and political restructuring after The Crash, including the constitutional revision process.  The  across-the-centre  grand  coalition  of  the  Independence  Party  and the Social Democratic Alliance was ousted after a series of protests known as the Pots and Pans revolution. Frustrated by the government’s lack  of  accountability  and  seeming  weakness  in  representing  Iceland’s  interests against the UK and Dutch governments in the Icesave dispute, the  public  took  to  the  streets  in  larger  numbers  than  ever  before.  In  Chapter  7  I  discuss  these  unprecedented  events  and  the  considerable  effect of the Icesave dispute.  In Chapters 8 and 9 I analyse Iceland’s economic recovery and political reform.  Five  years  after  suffering  one  of  the  most  profound  economic  crises  of  any  developed  country,  Iceland  was  performing  much  better  than  expected,  with  modest  growth  and  lower  unemployment  than  elsewhere in Europe.  As discussed in Chapter 9, political reform was, however, caught in a new  critical  order,  which  was  directly  opposed  to  proposed  reparative  moves. Initially, for example, the constitutional reform process was seen as  a  healing  process  but  gradually  this  too  was  politicized,  eventually  falling into traditional trenches of Icelandic party politics.  Relevant  conclusions  are  drawn  and  discussed  at  the  end  of  each  chapter. Short overall conclusions follow in a separate, final chapter that discusses the lessons of the Icelandic financial crisis. Each of the three parts – and indeed each chapter in the book – is structured in such a way that  it  can  be  read  independently.  Some  repetition  is  unavoidable  to  ensure the independence of each chapter. Those only interested in the story of the Icelandic Crash itself can, for example, skip over the three chapters in Part I, which provide the background and lay a theoretical basis for the following discussion. I recommend, however, reading the chapters in order.

According  to  historical tales a small society descended from Irish clergy had by then already  died  out.  Half  a  century  later,  the  Icelandic  state  was  formed  with  the  establishment  of  the    Alþingi   in  930.  The    Alþingi   was  a  parlia-mentary court held in a rocky gorge where the European and American tectonic plates meet. The cliffs created a natural loudspeaker so that all attendees  could  hear  the  voice  of  the  person  occupying  the  podium.  The site, located inland in the south of Iceland, was in accordance with its function named  Þingvellir , meaning ‘parliamentary fields’. After trou-bled  times  of  fierce  battles  between  the  main  noble  families,  Iceland  entered into a union with the King of Norway by an agreement that is now referred to as the Old Treaty. The importance of the  Alþingi  gradu-ally diminished but it wasn’t formally cancelled until the year 1800.  The  end  of  the  first  millennium  saw  increased  clashes  between  Christianity  and  the  old  pagan  religion.  The  matter  was  referred  to  the  sage  Þorgrímur  Ljósvetingagoði,  who,  after  a  period  of  reflection,  ruled on a compromise in the year 1000: that Icelanders should publicly convert to Christianity but still be allowed to continue worshiping their pagan  gods  in  private.  When  Norway  fell  under  Danish  rule  in  1380,  Iceland  was  brought  in  line  with  it.  Copenhagen  did  not,  however,  gain complete control over the country until Icelanders were forced to accept  the  absolute  power  of  the  Danish  king  in  1662.  From  then  on,  the  Alþingi  was only occasionally convened and solely in the capacity of a local court, having been stripped of its legislative powers. When abso-lutism was finally ended in Denmark in 1848, after a lengthy struggle for democratic  reform,  born  out  of  the  Enlightenment,  Icelanders  started     1   Birth of a Nation – A Postcolonical Project   ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":30,"content":"18   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisto fight for their independence, and the notion of a separate Icelandic nation was born.  The  first  step  towards  independence  was  taken  in  1844,  when  the   Alþingi  was ‘resurrected’ as an advisory parliamentary body in Reykjavik. A  new  democratic  constitution  came  into  force  in  Denmark  in  1849  and, after ending Iceland’s domestically elected Constitutional Assembly ( Þjóðfundurinn ) by force in 1951 and unilaterally deciding to keep control over the country in the Position Law’s ( Stöðulögin ) of 1871, the Danish king finally handed Icelanders their own constitution in 1874. Iceland was granted home rule in 1904, but with very limited executive powers. More  importantly,  sovereignty  was  won  in  1918,  which  included  full  internal  independence  and  for  the  most  part  external  control  within  a personal union with the Danish monarch as head of state. Full inde-pendence was to follow in 1944 – against the will of Denmark, when it was still under Nazi occupation (for more, see Karlsson, 2000).  Most students of Icelandic politics acknowledge the importance of the independence struggle in the development of its contemporary political identity. In this chapter I will explain how the myth of Iceland’s history was  used  to  construct  a  cultural-political  identity  that  emphasizes  formal  sovereignty  as  well  as  a  desire  to  be  recognized  as  a  partner  in  the Western world. As I will illustrate, Icelandic politics have been domi-nated  since  the  end  of  the  19th  century  by  the  nationalist  discourse  developed  during  the  independence  struggle.  As  will  become  further  evident  in  Chapter  4,  which  discusses  the  boom  years,  this  national-istic postcolonial political identity was indeed the driving force behind the Viking-like endeavours of Icelandic businessmen in Western Europe around the turn of the millennium. I therefore maintain that any model developed  to  study  Iceland’s  political  and  economic  development  as  well as its foreign relations cannot afford to ignore the extensive influ-ence of the colonial past. This is in line with, for example, Penny Griffin (2011), which frames poststructural analysis within critical International Political  Economy,  emphasizing  the  importance  of  studying  historical  links of exploitation, domination and force – for example in postcolo-nial relations.  Postcolonial  theories  emphasize  the  importance  of  analysing  the  impact  of  colonial  contact  on  contemporary  politics  and  the  cultural  legacy of colonialism, and thus critically explore the link between the past and the present – which I claim is central to an understanding of the  development  of  Iceland’s  politics  and  economy.  It  is  through  that  relationship that Iceland’s postcolonial national identity was created. It is therefore not a question of a temporary situation fading out over time ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":31,"content":"Birth of a Nation – A Postcolonical Project 19after  the  country  had  gained  independence,  but  rather  an  established  and  regularly  reconstructed  political  culture,  still  ongoing  in  contem-porary politics.    The independence struggle  In the realm of contemporary Icelandic politics, the legacy of the more than a century-long independence struggle in the 19th and early 20th century (1830–1944) is still very present. The publication of the journal  Ármann á   Alþingi , edited by Baldvin Einarsson, in Copenhagen in 1830 can  be  viewed  as  the  starting  point  of  the  struggle.  Further  journals  promoting Iceland’s autonomy followed, written by groups of Icelandic intellectuals  in  Copenhagen.  The  journal    Fjölnir   (1835–1847),  edited  by  a  group  of  romantic  nationalists,  and    Ný   félagsrit   (1841–1873),  led  by  Iceland’s  independence  hero  Jón  Sigurðsson,  were  the  most  influential.  The  struggle  was  fought  with  legal  argumentation  rather  than  with  arms; that is, with words rather than violence, thus emphasizing rhet-oric  over  force.  It  was  led  by  a  small  group  of  Icelandic  intellectuals  in  Copenhagen,  who,  by  referring  to  Iceland’s  history  of  independent  Vikings,  developed  a  national  myth  that  served  as  a  justification  for  their  emphasis  on  sovereignty  and  independence.  The  term    myth   is  here used in the sense that Iceland’s history was creatively interpreted to fit the claim for self-rule. According to the myth, Iceland is a unique nation  and  it  is  the  duty  of  all  Icelanders  to  actively  guard  its  sover-eignty and independence. History professor Guðmundur Hálfdanarson (2001: 96) explains how Iceland’s independence hero Jón Sigurðsson has since become the symbolic father of all Icelanders.  Icelandic historian Jón Sigurðsson (1811–1879), living in Copenhagen, gradually  emerged  as  the  leader  of  the  struggle  and  has  since  become  Iceland’s  national  hero.  Out  of  the  myth  interpreting  the  history  of  Iceland’s settlement republic (930–1262) he was instrumental in formu-lating the claim that Icelanders had a natural right, as a separate nation with  a  unique  language,  to  declare  its  self-rule.  Sigurðsson  became  President  of  the  Icelandic  Literary  Society  in  Copenhagen  and  later  President of the resurrected  Alþingi . Even though he was never President of Iceland, he is still referred to as ‘President Jón’ ( Jón forseti ). Iceland’s national day is on his birthday, 17 June. Historian Páll Björnsson (2010) documents that all camps in Icelandic politics – conservatives, commu-nists, nationalists and liberals alike – refer to Sigurðsson to advance and indeed to legitimize their arguments in contemporary politics.

Growing  from  a  population  of  around  60,000  inhabitants  in  the  mid-19th  century  to  330,000  at  present,  Iceland  borders  on  being  a  microstate.  However,  as  is  evident  from the following discourse analysis, even though its smallness surely puts limits on its administrative capacity to operate a fully functioning modern  independent  state,  no  alternative  is  ever  voiced  in  Icelandic  political  discourse.  To  propose  otherwise  would  be  considered  blas-phemy, which no politician would dare be accused of.  Counting  as  a  separate  nation  was  instrumental  to  the  demand  of  creating the Icelandic nation state. Young as the nation is, Icelanders can to a greater extent than perhaps most other social groups claim to consti-tute a nation. As an island located far out in the Atlantic Ocean Iceland is  isolated  from  other  countries.  Icelanders  speak  their  own  language  and  are  of  the  same  ethnicity  and  most  accept  traditional  Christian  values.  Most  Icelanders,  furthermore,  have  a  similar  understanding  of  their history and are united in valuing their literary heritage.    The colonial heritage  Only  a  handful  of  scholars,  mainly  those  analysing  Icelandic  cultural  relations,  have  studied  the  importance  of  the  country’s  colonial  past.  Anthropology Professor Kristín Loftsdóttir (2011), for example, analysed how the colonial experience was instrumental in shaping our national identity,  which  was  formulated  in  close  dialogue  with  European  colo-nial   identity.   Since   then   it   had   been   ‘constantly   remanufactured   through various discourses and praxis’ (Loftsdóttir, 2011). By studying the representations of the Viking image in Icelandic rhetoric Ann-Sofie Nielsen Germaud (2010) examines the importance of the colonial past in  Iceland’s  contemporary  discourse.  She  concludes  that  the  Viking  notion  is  a  central  but  changeable  element  in  the  modern  collective  Icelandic self-image. Referring to Claude Lévi-Stauss’s division of socie-ties according to their ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ relationship with the past, Nielsen Germaud  categorizes  Iceland  as  a  clearly  ‘hot  society’  ‘where  history  is  an  internalized  generation  that  helps  to  contextualize  the  future  through historically based cultural memory’ (Nielsen Germaud, 2010). The discursive representation of the past is indeed continually present in Icelandic politics. Accordingly, it can be argued that the contempo-rary political condition in Iceland is very much a result of its historical relationship with neighbouring countries. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":33,"content":"Birth of a Nation – A Postcolonical Project 21 Evidence   for   this   was,   for   example,   found   in   Prime   Minister   Gunnlaugsson’s  first  address  to  the  nation,  on  Iceland’s  national  day,  on 17 June 2013, in which he discussed Iceland’s ‘No’ vote in the refer-endum  on  the  Icesave  agreement.  Referring  to  the  Viking  heritage,  he  explained  that  precisely  because  they  were  descended  from  Vikings,  Icelanders were independently minded and would thus not surrender to foreign authority (Gunnlaugsson, 2013).  This  is  in  line  with  Andreas  Huyssen’s  (2001)  claim  that  a  frame-work for understanding the present is built through remembering past events, where the past even constitutes the source of understanding for complex global interrelations in the present. Importantly, he points out that this involves a successful marketing of these collective memories. The constant and continuous remembrance of the past thus provides a framework  and  context  for  an  understanding  of  the  present.  Anthony  Smith (1993) explains how collective memories in relation to a colonial past can even be contradictory and inconsistent.  Along  these  lines,  Loftsdóttir  (2010)  stresses  that  the  Icelandic  case  indeed indicates how relationships and identities of the late 19th- and early 20th-century colonial/imperial world are remembered in a partic-ular  way,  and  thus  continue  to  haunt  the  present.  She  explains  how  contemporary  interpretations  of  the  state  of  the  economy  stand  in  a  dynamic relationship with a notion of its past. Interestingly, however, despite many scholars’ reference to the importance of the postcolonial relationship when analysing Iceland’s political identity, no wide-ranging study has until now been made on how it has affected the development of our political economy and foreign relations.  The  colonial  past  is  also  vividly  present  in  contemporary  popular  culture, as can be found in Björk’s song ‘Declare Independence’, which she dedicated to Greenland and the Faroe Island and also performed in Tibet.  In  an  interview  with    The   Australian   she  explained  how  being  a  colony of Norway and Denmark had left its mark on her nation’s psyche, bringing, for example, ‘lack of confidence’ and ‘mistrust of foreigners’ (quoted in Westwood, 2008).    The national myth  Iceland’s national myth, which developed in the independence struggle, creates  a  Golden  Age  starting  with  the  settlement  in  the  year  874,  peaking after the state-like formulation in 930 and ending when Iceland fell under foreign rule with the Old Treaty with Norway in 1262. Further deterioration occurs when falling under Danish rule in 1380 and with ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":34,"content":"22   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisintroduction of Absolutism in 1662. Several texts were later influential in reaffirming this myth. Jón Jónsson Aðils (1869–1920), who in 1911 became  Iceland’s  first  history  professor,  described  the  society  of  the  Golden Age as superior to all others and its unique and pure language as the key to its soul. He claimed that Icelanders not only had enjoyed the highest standard of living but that their culture was so rich that it ‘only compares  to  ancient  Greece  during  the  highest  period  of  civilization’  (Jónsson Aðils, 1903).  According to the myth, Icelandic society started to deteriorate after the country  entered  into  the  Old  Treaty.  A  period  of  humiliation  followed  after it fell under Danish rule. But Jónsson Aðils and his followers explain that,  however  weak  and  humiliated  the  people  may  have  been,  the  Icelandic national spirit never died, and at last, in the early 19th century, courageous and wise men finally rose up and reclaimed the nation’s own worth and lifted the national spirit by fighting for its independence. As Nielsen  Germaud  (2011)  explains,  the  myth  creates  a  U-shaped  curve  of history, whose two peaks – in the distant past and at the end of the story – represent autonomy and the avoidance of external influence.  Importantly  for  future  development,  the  purity  of  the  nation  and  language is emphasized. Jónsson Aðils expressed the hope that Icelanders would  in  the  future  have  the  opportunity  to  demonstrate  to  other  nations their importance in world culture, thus articulating Icelanders’ desire to be recognized as equals by their powerful neighbouring states.  This myth was kept alive throughout the 20th century, for example, in schoolbooks. One was written by Jónas Jónsson frá Hriflu, an educator who  later  became  the  leader  of  the  Progressive  Party  and  one  of  the  most  influential  figures  in  Icelandic  politics  and  culture.  According  to  his  textbook,  read  by  all  elementary  students  for  decades,  Iceland’s  economic  prosperity  is  directly  attributed  to  its  gaining  independence  from Denmark. Icelanders are furthermore pictured as the finest ‘selec-tion’ of Norwegians, descendants of the strong and independent-minded farmers who fled the oppression of King Harald to protect their freedom. He then claims that this noble breed of Norway’s finest social class was through the centuries shaped by the harshness of the natural surround-ings, creating the unique Icelandic nation, which compares to no other. Historian  Guðmundur  Finnbogason  (1925)  further  claimed  that  the  harsh Icelandic environment had through the centuries weeded out the weakest and thus even increased the quality of the population. As I will explain further in Chapter 4, this is the myth our President was tapping into  in  the  boom  years  when  explaining  how  Icelanders  were  all  but  destined for greatness in the new global economy.

This is also in line with philosopher Frantz Fanon’s (1963) claim that  nationalism  in  colonized  countries  might  seem  more  aggressive  as its liberation movements use it to separate themselves from its colo-nizers by emphasizing their distinctiveness. Interestingly, however, in the  Icelandic  case,  the  independence  struggle  not  only  expressed  the  desire to be different but also the desire to be recognized as a partner in Western culture.  Iceland’s  independence  movement  clearly  drew  its  ideas  from  inter-national  trends  at  the  time,  most  importantly  the  Enlightenment  and  Romanticism.  However,  when  the  policy  for  sovereignty  and  later  full  independence  –  Icelandic  nationalism  –  was  being  developed,  its  creators  looked  back  a  thousand  years,  to  the  settlement  republic,  for  arguments  to  justify  their  claim  rather  than  to  current  international  development (Hermannsson, 2005: 83). The emphasis was on drawing an  unbroken  link  to  the  Golden  Age  rather  than  on  linking  the  inde-pendence  struggle  with  international  ideological  developments  of  the  time. Iceland’s path to modernization and progress was therefore seen through its own unique past rather than with reference to international trends  (Hermannsson,  2005:  252,  292).  Illustrative  of  this  trend  is  the  naming  of  Iceland’s  new  Parliament  in  Reykjavik  in  1844  after  the   Alþingi . The old parliamentary court in  Þingvellir  (parliamentary fields) had become the holy site of the Icelandic nation, in which it is forever recreated through collective memory.  In  his  landmark  study,  Guðmundur  Hálfdanarson  (2001:  36–39)  explains how this sense of nationalism was stronger than in most other European states at the time, being based on a historical conviction that justified  the  full  formal  sovereignty  and  independence  of  the  nation.  The nation became almost a concrete natural fact in the Icelandic mind. A free and sovereign Icelandic nation became an integral part of the self-image of the nation. Icelandic nationalism was thus created on the basis of a romantic notion of a natural and pure, or at least special, separate nation. This notion became a vital force in the independence struggle.  The Icelandic History Association has repeatedly tried to correct this myth – without much success. For example, it announced that an offi-cial report on Iceland’s image in 2008 (which I will discuss further in Chapter  4)  was  in  stark  contrast  to  contemporary  historical  research.  Still,  the  myth  was  constantly  reconstructed  and  easily  survived  The  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":36,"content":"24   Iceland and the International Financial CrisisCrash.  In  his  book  on  Iceland’s  economic  collapse  the  former  Chief  Economist  of  Kaupthing  Bank,  turned  Lecturer  in  Economics  after  The  Crash,  Ásgeir  Jónsson  (2009)  starts  his  analysis  by  reproducing  the myth of the Golden Age in a long introductory chapter, where he explains  how  Iceland  was  built  by  free-spirited  Norwegians  who  were  fleeing  oppression  in  Norway  and  finding  freedom  in  Iceland.  Then  Iceland  lost  its  autonomy,  falling  into  poverty  and  a  dormant  mode  of  existence  under  foreign  rule.  Working  his  way  through  the  myth,  Jónsson  describes  how  economic  prosperity  emerged  with  independ-ence. He goes on to branding the boom years between 1997 and 2007 Iceland’s ‘Golden Decade’. For another example of this national myth in  contemporary  discourse  we  can  turn  to  former  TV  journalist  Elin  Hirst, announcing her parliamentary candidates for the IP leading up to the 2013 election: ‘Iceland is a small nation that has in a miraculously short time risen from being the poorest state in Europe to being one of the  richest  in  the  world,  precisely  because  it  finally  got  to  control  its  own affairs’ (Hirst, 2012).    Equal partner  Equally  importantly,  the  external  struggle  for  sovereignty  was  also  fuelled  by  a  wish  for  external  recognition  as  being  an  equal  partner  with  the  other  states  of  Europe.  Political  scientist  Birgir  Hermannsson  (2005:  125–127)  documents  that  Iceland’s  struggle  for  independence  was not only an effort to gain authority over its own affairs but also a vehicle for the promotion of modernization in a country that had been one of the poorest and most backward in Europe for centuries. Formally Iceland  was  not  a  colony  of  Denmark  but  rather  a  dependency,  or  a  ‘bi-land’ as it was called in Denmark. The position of the Icelanders in the  19th  century  was  ambiguous,  as  Loftsdóttir  (2010)  explains:  they  were generally not represented as complete ‘savages’, but neither as fully belonging  among  ‘civilised’  peoples.  Nineteenth-century  travel  books  depict Icelanders as uncivilized, dirty and lacy while also characterizing the population with romantic fulfilment.  Frustration  with  this  depiction  was,  for  example,  reflected  in  the  protest  of  Icelandic  students  in  1905  against  being  portrayed  as  colo-nial subjects in a Danish colonial exhibition in Copenhagen – as they did  not  want  to  be  associated  with  colonized  people  from  Greenland  and Africa. This illustrates the internal wish of being distinguished from other subjugated or colonized peoples. Despite being a dependency of Denmark, Iceland situated itself within imperial Europe when speaking ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":37,"content":"Birth of a Nation – A Postcolonical Project 25of  the  exploration  and  colonization  of  the  world.  This  can  be  seen  in  19th-century textbooks (Loftsdóttir, 2010). The objection to being asso-ciated  with  other  colonies  in  the  Danish  colonial  exhibition  was  not  with  the  inhumanity  of  the  exercise  but  rather  of  being  displayed  on  the  wrong  side,  thus  revealing  their  anxieties  of  being  classified  with  colonized  people.  Being  recognized  within  white  Western  culture  was  central for Icelanders in the context of finding their place in the hier-archy of civilized peoples (Nielsen Germaud, 2010).  This struggle for external recognition has ever since been reflected in both internal and external discussions. Icelanders are still preoccupied with  the  image  of  the  country  internationally.  Anthropologists  Gísli  Pálsson and Paul Durrenberger (1992: 313), for example, claim that the primary task amongst Icelanders writing on external relations is not so much to understand others but to be understood  by  them.    The Vikings  The use of Viking imagery illustrates this preoccupation quite well. As I will explain further when analysing the boom years, the internal celebra-tion of the endeavours of Iceland’s businessmen abroad, usually referred to as Iceland’s  outvasion , is a reflection of the striving for recognition as a partner in Western culture. The term outvasion ( útrás ) means the oppo-site of the word ‘ innrás ’, invasion, but also plays on an old word, literally meaning ‘release of tension’. With the sudden flocking of Icelandic busi-nessmen  abroad  around  the  turn  of  the  second  millennium,  the  word  outvasion took on a new meaning: the acquisition of companies abroad (Magnússon,  2011).  Accordingly,  the  businessmen  themselves  were  positively referred to as Outvasion Vikings ( útrásarvíkingar ). The whole idea  behind  the  outvasion  concept  was  indeed  fuelled  by  its  symbolic  meaning of marking Iceland’s complete entry into modernity.  This digs deep into the myth of the Viking past in emphasizing mascu-line qualities and the narrative of world explorers. Contrary to its signifi-cance  in  many  other  places,  the  Viking  image  is  positive  in  Icelandic  discourse,  where  it  symbolizes  Iceland’s  Golden  Age  –  representing  a  time  of  political  autonomy  and  cultural  greatness.  Viking  imagery  appears, for example, in myths, images, sagas and legends and has been significant  in  Iceland’s  feuds  and  negotiations  with  neighbours  where  they  represent  the  characteristics  of  the  collective.  In  both  contempo-rary  Icelandic  culture  and  external  national  branding,  Viking  imagery  is very present. It can be found on statues in public spaces as well as on consumer products like beer cans and sports scarves. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":38,"content":"26   Iceland and the International Financial Crisis Many  businessmen  played  on  the  Viking  symbols.  Leading  Viking  Capitalist Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson (Glitnir, Iceland frozen food, Baugur, Hamlays, Magasin du Nord), for example, named his yacht  The Viking  and decorated the entrance hall of his London office with a three-metre high  statue  of  the  earliest  known  world  explorer  in  Iceland,  Leifur  Eiríksson  (who  lived  around  1000  AD  and  allegedly  sailed  to  America  500 years before Columbus). Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson (Landsbanki, Straumur,  West  Ham  United)  played  on  old  Nordic  mythology  in  the  logo  of  his  company  Novator.  One  of  the  leading  Viking  Capitalists,  Hannes Smárason, explained how foreign acquisitions could be traced to the energy of the Viking spirit (Schram, 2009).  Leading  members  of  the  more  benign  cultural  outvasion  nourished  the  same  notion.  In  an  interview  with  the    Guardian   in  March  2008,  bassist  Georg  Holm  of  the  famous  band  Sigur  Ros  was  quoted:  ‘Like  all  Icelanders,  we  are  intensely  proud  of  our  mighty  homeland  in  the  far North Atlantic’, adding that it was ‘in our Viking blood to want to conquer nations and peoples’ (quoted in Hooper, 2008).  I maintain that these positive connotations of the outvasion concept and the widespread internal acceptance of the endeavours of the Viking Capitalists can only be fully understood in connection with a particular memory of the past and speaks to the fear of being perceived by others as  lacking  modernity.  The  outvasion  notion  thus  digs  into  the  wider  discourse  on  national  identity  that  revolves  around  living  in  a  harsh  environment  and  surviving  through  centuries  of  hardship,  as  articu-lated  by  our  President.  When  explaining  the  unique  characteristics  of  the  Icelandic  businessmen,  he  listed  13  qualities,  one  of  which  was  a  ‘heritage of discovery and exploration fostered by the medieval Viking sagas’ (Grímsson, 2005).  In Chapter 4 I will discuss further how nationalistic rhetoric was used to make sense of the economic boom. This perhaps wishful thinking that Iceland  was  making  its  final  entry  into  modernity  through  the  outva-sion revolves around the interplay between desires and anxieties within Iceland’s national identity. Loftsdóttir (2012) maintains that these anxi-eties have been part of Iceland’s national discourse for a long time and are ‘interconnected with the desire to gain recognition from the more powerful  European  nation  states’.  Interestingly,  but  correspondingly,  the  nationalistic  discourse  only  intensified  with  the  country’s  greater  involvement in the global economy, with increased focus on the image of  the  Viking  Capitalists.  National  images  were  recycled,  renegotiated  and  even  reformulated  in  a  highly  globalized  context,  as  Loftsdóttir  (2012)  explains:  ‘stressing  the  complex  interplay  between  the  notions  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":39,"content":"Birth of a Nation – A Postcolonical Project 27“global”  and  “local”’.  Investment  overseas  and  increased  participation  in  global  markets  is  thus  seen  as  a  continuation  of  the  independence  struggle.    Ever lasting struggle  When studying Iceland’s nation-building, it can be seen that the fragility of the nation is always present. The notion of constant threat to its very existence  can,  for  example,  been  found  in  the  writings  of  parliamen-tarian Bjarni Jónsson at the beginning of the 20th century. After claiming that the nation as such is the core of their spiritual life he insists that all  ‘good  Icelanders’  should  do  their  utmost  to  ‘protect  and  promote  their nationality’ (quoted in Bjarnason, 2013: 21). Otherwise, Icelanders ran the risk of ‘vanishing in the vast ocean of nations.’ To prevent such devastation, Icelanders had to nourish their cultural heritage and indeed ‘prove both to themselves and to others that they are a living nation.’ In 1907, the largest newspaper in Reykjavik similarly wrote that Icelanders must  be  proactive  in  showing  others  that  on  the  island  lives  a  ‘sepa-rated and remarkable cultural nation [ ... ] this we must strive to become recognised  for  throughout  the  educated  word’  (quoted  in  ‘Ísland  fyrir  Íslendinga’, 1907).  The success of this struggle – for external recognition as a fully func-tioning modern state deeply rooted in Western culture – was threatened when the crisis hit in autumn 2008. Further anxiety was felt after misre-porting  in  the  international  media  after  The  Crash,  speaking  directly  to  the  longstanding  fear  of  misrecognition  by  foreigners.  Iceland’s  economic  relationship  with  others  is  interpreted  through  a  romantic  nationalistic discourse; thus, the meaning of the crisis cannot be reduced to a purely economic level. To understand the real meaning of the crisis in Iceland its impact on identity and Iceland’s position in the world has to be taken into account.  It should be stressed here that Iceland’s national myth is not unique. Indeed, many nations base their nationhood on similar kinds of myth creation. This is what Anthony D. Smith (1993) calls the ‘Cult of a Golden Age’: the fact that national leaders often refer to a Golden Age in time of hardship to reinforce a sense of community. What is, however, inter-esting is that after Iceland had gained full independence the independ-ence  struggle  did  not  end.  Rather,  a  new  one  started:  the  ever-lasting  independence  struggle.  And  a  new  political  idea  was  born:  the  notion  that  the  fight  for  independence  is  a  constant  struggle  and  that  it  will  never end (Bergmann, 2011a). Accordingly, it is the collective duty of all ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":40,"content":"28   Iceland and the International Financial CrisisIcelanders to guard the country’s independence. In his landmark study on Icelandic politics, including the Icelandic political identity, political science  professor  Ólafur  Ragnar  Grímsson  (1978),  later  President  of  Iceland, claimed that this common understanding of Icelandic nation-alism,  created  in  the  independence  struggle,  had  since  become  one  of  the most important ideas in Icelandic political discourse.    Conclusion  Iceland’s postcolonial national identity brings forward a dual insistence, as  has  been  demonstrated:  on  being  formally  sovereign  as  well  as  on  being recognised as an equal partner in Europe. This has developed into what can be termed the Icelandic Postcolonial Project. The dual insist-ence has also developed into a divide in Icelandic politics between  isola-tionists   and    internationalists .  One  side  emphasizes  independence  while  the other expresses a wish to be a fully functioning modern economy on an equal footing with other participants in Western culture. While one part of the national identify pulls Iceland away from others, by empha-sizing its uniqueness, the other part is pushing us into participating in the global economy to further Iceland’s prosperity. However, as a small state, bordering even on being defined as a microstate, Iceland struggles with both claims.  These  two  sides  of  Iceland’s  national  identify  are  often  at  odds,  creating a tension regarding its direction that is debated in internal polit-ical discussions. It is precisely within these boundaries where Iceland’s postcolonial sovereignty games are played – as I will discuss further in Chapter  3,  which  deals  with  Iceland’s  foreign  relations.  This  defining  struggle can be identified throughout the development of the economy, with   an   emphasis   on   diversification   directing   the   resource-based   economy  towards  an  unsustainable,  finance-driven  Viking  economy  around the turn of the millennium. The effect of the postcolonial iden-tity  is  perhaps  most  evident  in  Iceland’s  foreign  relations,  bringing  it,  through the EEA agreement, into the European Single Market without its  enjoying  the  institutional  protection  of  formal  membership  when  the crisis hit. Furthermore, as analysed later in this book, the postcolo-nial national identity also defined Iceland’s response to the crisis after it hit the country severely in autumn 2008.

Being based on fishing, Iceland’s economy is characterized by continuous boom and bust cycles. The crisis of 2008 might have been more profound than others, but this sort of volatility in the economy is nothing uncommon for Icelanders.  Until  the  mid-19th  century  Iceland  was  isolated  and  remained  at  medieval level with little or no growth. There were no towns to speak of. Most people worked for food and lodging on family run farms in the countryside. There was hardly any functional monetary or other sort of financial system. Rather, Iceland was like a still picture from the Middle Ages – a frozen society. A small number of farmers produced traditional food products and the Danish monarch monopolized all foreign trade. In 1855 the Danish Crown finally liberalized external trade, which allowed the relatively late emergence of capitalism. Alongside the independence struggle Icelanders campaigned for freedom in foreign trade but after the liberalization of external trade we still kept tight controls on domestic trade. Workers, for example, were until the late 19th century forced to work on farms in certain regions and were banned from seeking more lucrative jobs elsewhere or in other sectors, such as in the new fishing towns around the coast (for more, see Gunnarsson, 1987).  Iceland’s approach to foreign trade can be explained by the still ongoing tension between those who advocated caution in foreign relations and promoted  a  self-sufficient  economy  and  those  who  campaigned  for  openness to foreign markets and strove for participation in international       2   Coming of Age – Economic History   ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":42,"content":"30   Iceland and the International Financial Crisistrade co-operation. This tension between  isolationists  and  international-ists  still characterizes Iceland’s postcolonial national identity and stems directly  from  the  previously  described  dilemma  of  the  independence  struggle:  to  be  at  once  independent  from  foreign  authority  but  still  recognized as a prosperous modern economy on an equal footing with other Western states.    Early fragile finanicalization  The rise and fall of Íslandsbanki (Iceland’s Bank) in early 20th century can serve as an interesting parallel to the events leading up to the crisis in the early 21st century. In many ways the establishment of Íslandsbanki in  1904  marks  the  start  of  the  boom  and  bust  cycle  which  Iceland’s  economy has been marked by ever since. The joint-stock venture bank was  created  by  the    Alþingi   and  sponsored  by  the  Danish  Crown.  The  bank was, however, privately owned by Danish investors. Not so uncom-monly for the tide of the time, this private foreign bank served simul-taneously as Iceland’s central bank and the country’s only commercial bank.  This  was  considered  acceptable  as  Iceland  was  still  a  part  of  the  Danish Kingdom and the bank was, like almost all other central banks of the time, to base the worth of its notes on the international gold standard and could therefore not print money of its own accord. Establishment of  this  first  real  financial  institution  had  revolutionary  effects  for  the  small and weak enterprises in the country, which for centuries had been starved of foreign cash. Throughout the 19th century Iceland had been served  by  the  domestic  Landsbanki  (National  bank  of  Iceland)  and  a  few savings and loans institutions, which did not have access to foreign funding (Baldvinsdóttir, 1998).  Access to foreign investment capital was pivotal for the rapid economic growth  in  the  20th  century.  This  country,  which  in  economic  terms  had  been  dormant  for  centuries,  was  now  wide  awake.  The  large-scale  emigration to America that had started in the mid-19th century finally slowed  and  gradually  reversed  in  the  early  20th  century  (Bjarnason,  2013).  Fuelled  by  the  nationalistic  sentiments  of  the  independence  struggle, this relatively backward society was thirsting for rapid modern-ization.  Íslandsbanki  mainly  invested  in  the  fisheries  sector,  which  in  the  coming  years  increased  foreign  revenues  many  times  over.  Motor  trawlers were bought to catch more fish than before and processing facili-ties were built, further increasing the value of the catch. The British were demanding fresh cod for their ‘fish and chips’ and the Spanish seemed to need an endless supply of salted fish for their  bacalao . Business was ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":43,"content":"Coming of Age – Economic History 31booming.  The  bank  furthermore  offered  deposit  accounts  to  a  popu-lation  that  had  until  then  mostly  kept  their  modest  savings  at  home.  This  led  to  initial  small-scale  money  multiplication  and  indeed  primi-tive  financialization  of  the  society.  Industrialization  of  the  economy  soon emerged and for 16 years after Ísalndsbanki was founded in 1904 Iceland enjoyed steady growth with greater prosperity than before (for more, see Jónsson, 2009).  With increased liberalization, Iceland’s late-emerging capitalism came to  centre  on  a  regime  of  extensive  accumulation  of  absolute  surplus  value extraction through the expansion of the fishing sector. Facilitated by  a  very  basic  technological  upgrade  (basic  trawler  vessels  and  fish  processing equipment), this expansion took place on the basis of large numbers  of  workers  seeking  wage-labour  in  coastal  towns  and  away  from quasi-peonage agricultural labour relations in the countryside. In 1900 most of the population worked in agriculture. In the first decades of the 20th century, however, people flocked from the agricultural coun-tryside  to  the  fishing  towns.  Reykjavik  emerged  as  the  new  economic  hub. Its population grew from 10 per cent of the national total in 1900 to 40 per cent in 1930. This development was to continue, as now, in the  21st  century,  two-thirds  of  Iceland’s  population  live  in  the  greater  Reykjavik area.  With this early financialization came the formation of a bourgeoisie of merchants and entrepreneurs, which would come to revolve around 14 families, popularly known as ‘The Octopus’, and wage-labourers around an  industrialization,  monetization,  entrepreneurship  and  productivity  (Árnason, 1991). Closely linked to the Independence Party The Octopus dominated many branches of the economy, including fishing, imports, petrol  distribution,  shipping  and  insurance,  and  held  a  monopoly  on  much  of  the  country’s  business  with  the  American  army  base.  Trade  unions emerged after the turn of the century. However, the political arm of the labour movement, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), was small by Scandinavian standards and was dominated by a social-liberal faction, which accepted individualism and the pursuit of wealth (Kristjánsson, 1977). Yet, wage-labour, the basic technological upgrade and infrastruc-tural development needed funding. The accumulation strategy pointed to the institutionalization of a credit system.  This primitive financial system, instituted in the first years of the last century, was, however, very vulnerable, which is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that a single bankruptcy of a fishing company in 1914 almost killed  off  Íslandsbanki  when  it  lost  more  than  quarter  of  its  equity.

By  the  end  of  the  war  the stock price of the bank had doubled (Jónsson, 2009). Another effect of  WWI  was  the  suspension  of  the  gold  standard,  which  resulted  in  central  banks  being  freed  to  print  money.  Íslandsbanki  exploited  this  new  monetary  regime  by  spewing  new  cash  into  the  economy.  After  WWI, pressure to devalue the Icelandic króna (ISK) thus started to build, accompanying  increased  inflation  –  which  Iceland  has  been  infested  with  ever  since.  Prices  quadrupled  and  outstanding  banknote  issues  increased sevenfold (Baldvinsdóttir, 1998). Still the government insisted on  keeping  the  peg  with  the  Danish  krona  (DKK)  as  both  currencies  were at the time considered legal tender in Iceland. By 1920, however, it was impossible to keep the ISK trading at par with the DKK – thus the saga of the constant devaluation of the ISK started. By 2012, the ISK had fallen by almost 100 per cent against the DKK.  The creation of Íslandsbanki, this mediating mechanism in the mode of regulation, led to the trans-nationalization of Icelandic capital accu-mulation  and  could  have  laid  the  foundations  of  a  more  intensive  regime  of  accumulation.  Indeed,  Íslandsbanki’s  ability  to  ensure  the  steady inflow of investment capital presented the key legitimate test of this new historical block’s capacity to routinize this regime of accumula-tion.  Trouble  started  for  Íslandsbanki,  however,  when  Europe  entered  into  recession  in  1920  and  fish  prices  fell  sharply  on  international  markets.  The  bank  was  bailed  out  through  government  involvement  with  emergency  loans  from  Denmark  and  the  UK.  The  ability  of  the  bank to operate as a credible central bank was subsequently questioned. Many suspected Íslandsbanki, a  foreign  bank, of serving  external  interests, mainly its Danish shareholders (Jónsson, 2009). Based on national senti-ments this spurred increasing discussion on establishing domestic finan-cial services, which would be focused on serving only the interest of this newly established sovereign state. Icelanders had tasted the benefits of investment banking for economic growth. Now they wanted their own public bank, Landsbanki, to take over central banking operations from the  private,  foreign-owned  Íslandsbanki.  This  was  not  only  to  protect  the  country’s  economic  interests  but  also  to  nourish  the  nationalistic  sentiments  developing  in  the  independence  struggle.  Independence  from  the  Danish  Kingdom  had  become  a  hegemonic  element  of  the  Icelandic  societal  paradigm  (Bergmann,  2011a).  Ridding  Iceland  of  foreign economic interest was therefore seen as a vital part of protecting the sovereign status that had only recently been won. Íslandsbanki had negotiated note-issuing rights until 1933. Now it had become the victim of  Icelandic  nationalism.  In  the  early  1920s,  the  Icelandic  authorities  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":45,"content":"Coming of Age – Economic History 33decided to gradually shift money-issuing rights to its own Landsbanki, with exclusive rights to print the national currency from 1928. By 1933, Íslandsbanki was to repurchase all its outstanding note issues.  Rather as happened after The Crash of 2008, the private, foreign-owned Íslandsbanki was in the late 1920s left to fend for itself under a drasti-cally  altered  situation,  at  least  partly  created  by  domestic  government  decisions. The bank had to either massively shrink its balance sheet or find a new funding base. Íslandsbanki suffered further blows when the Great  Depression  of  1929  hit,  when,  for  example,  two  fishing  compa-nies that amounted to a significant share of the bank’s loan book went bankrupt.  To  add  insult  to  injury  Landsbanki  refused  to  extend  a  bill  it  had  bought  from  Íslandsbanki,  which  spurred  a  run  on  its  deposits.  The  Alþingi  then forced the issue, categorically refusing to bail out the foreign  bank.  Íslandsbanki  did  not  have  the  means  to  withstand  this  twofold blow: the international depression and unfavourable domestic government  decisions.  This  marked  the  end  of  international  banking  in Iceland for centuries. After gaining sovereignty in 1918, Iceland lost access  to  international  financial  markets  after  nationalizing  banking  services. Following the fall of Íslandsbanki the government nationalized the operation and opened Útvegsbankinn, a joint-stock Fisheries Bank of Iceland.  Just  as  Íslandsbanki  was  bailed  out  by  government  intervention  in  1920, Landsbanki found itself in trouble a decade later when the effects of  the  Great  Depression  started  to  bite.  In  1931,  the  Icelandic  govern-ment agreed on the Landsbanki petition to introduce capital controls – which remained in force until 1994, when Iceland entered into the EEA agreement. It is often claimed that history is destined to repeat itself – that  year,  1994,  then  marked  the  prelude  to  the  next  banking  bubble,  which burst in October 2008.  Further sectoral banking institutions were introduced after the Great Depression.  Búnaðarbankinn,  the  public  agricultural  bank,  established  in  1930,  was  sponsored  by  the  Progressive  Party  (PP),  which  was  the  political  arm  of  the  Co-operative  Movement.  Three  private  banks  also  emerged.  Iðnaðarbankinn,  the  Bank  of  Industries,  opened  its  doors  in  1953; Verslunarbankinn, the Bank of Commerce, was founded in 1961; and Alþýðubankinn, the People’s Bank, was established in 1971 – partly sponsored by the Social Democratic Party. These banks represented the interests of competing sectors of the economy, each claiming to repre-sent  progress,  albeit  through  innovation  in  agricultural  production  and  the  promotion  of  industrialization.  Iceland  subsequently  became  overbanked  as  the  rival  banks  competed  by  opening  more  and  more  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":46,"content":"34   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisbranches  around  the  country.  Key  outcomes  were  a  degree  of  isola-tionism and a slowing of industrialization and diversification. In 1988, the three private sectoral banks acquired Útvegsbankinn and emerged as a new Íslandsbanki.    Party of four  Iceland’s political party system was taking shape in the early 20th century. Ever since, the system has consisted of four main but shifting parties (for more, see Kristinsson, 2006). Despite repeated attempts, efforts to break up this party of four have thus far failed. The right-of-centre Independence Party (IP) ( Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn ) emerged as the largest political party and indeed the country’s hegemonic power. The bourgeois conservative party was  able  to  simultaneously  tap  into  the  heritage  of  the  independence  struggle and promote liberal economic policies. It is closely linked with the Confederation of Icelandic Employers (SA), including the Association of Fishing Vessel Owners (LÍÚ). Since its creation in 1929 the IP has been in government for most of the 20th century and the period leading up to The Crash of 2008, usually in coalition with either the PP or the SDP/SDA. The agricultural Progressive Party (PP) ( Framsóknarflokkurinn ) occu-pied  the  centre  of  Icelandic  politics  and  was  often  able  to  increase  its  importance by forming coalitions with both left and right.  The left wing in Icelandic politics was weakened by frequent fragmenta-tion in 20th century. The Social Democratic Party (SDP) ( Alþýðuflokkuirnn ) was  established  in  1916  as  the  political  wing  of  the  labour  movement  (ASI)  (  Alþýðusamband  Íslands ).  In  1930,  a  communist  group  split  from  the party, marking a continued fragmentation in the coming decades. In the latter half of the century the People’s Alliance (PA) ( Alþýðuband  alagið ) emerged as the united home of those on the left of the SDP. The splinter was mainly a cause of foreign policy issues, and the classical divide in Icelandic  politics  between    internationalists   and    isolationists   ran  straight  down  the  spine  of  the  left.  While  the  SDP  promoted  participation  in  international  organizations  like  NATO  and  the  European  integration  project,  the  PA  was  more  rooted  in  the  heritage  of  the  independence  struggle  and  concerned  with  protecting  Iceland’s  sovereignty  against  Western forces. Indeed, it was a peculiarity of Icelandic socialists in the early  20th  century  that  they  were  far  more  nationalistic  than  similar  parties in other European countries (Kristjánsdóttir, 2008). This split has remained ever since.  Attempts  at  uniting  the  left  continued  throughout  the  century.  The  latest serious attempt was made around the turn of the millennium with ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":47,"content":"Coming of Age – Economic History 35the  merger  of  the  SDP  and  the  PA  together  with  two  satellite  parties  into  the  Social  Democratic  Alliance  (SDA)  (  Samfylkingin ).  In  effect,  however, that attempt was foiled by the establishment of the Left Green Movement (LGM) ( Vinstri Hreyfingin –   grænt framboð ), which was almost instantly  able  to  fill  the  space  to  the  left  of  the  SDA  that  the  PA  had  previously occupied.  In  addition  to  these  four  main  parties,  a  fifth  and  sometimes  also  sixth parties have temporarily occupied up to 15 per cent of the seats in Parliament. The longest surviving of these extra parties was the Women’s List ( Kvennalistinn ), which was represented in Parliament between 1983 and 1999, until it merged with others into the SDA.  Through  most  of  the  20th  century,  the  Icelandic  economy  was  split  between  the  main  ruling  parties,  the  IP  and  PP.  It  was  heavily  controlled  by  regulations,  governmental  licensing,  and  import  and  export  controls.  This  was  branded  ‘the  rule  of  halves.   1    Most  private  firms  were  closely  tied  to  the  IP  through  the  Employers  Association  and  the  powerful  Co-operative  Movement  was  in  effect  the  business  branch of the Progressive Party. The Co-operative Movement controlled companies in most fields of the economy and was for a while, because of  its  centrist  organization,  the  most  influential  in  the  economy.  The  rule of halves was partially broken when the Co-operative Movement collapsed in 1992.    Rich in fish  For  centuries  Icelanders  had  been  isolated  from  the  tumult  of  the  world. During the Second World War, however, Iceland became geos-tratically  important  which  brought  increased  foreign  attention.  We  were rushed to instant modernization after the British Navy landed at Reykjavik in 1940. The war brought much needed work for a starving workforce and a massive inflow of foreign cash when US troops took over  this  isolated  northern  outpost  of  the  war  in  1941.  Buoyed  by  foreign cash, the economy instantly took off, which in turn provided us with enough confidence to push for complete independence from Denmark in 1944.  All of a sudden Iceland also found itself in a vital geostrategic posi-tion,  between  the  superpowers  of  the  world,  which  it  was  able  to  exploit  throughout  the  Cold  War  to  advance  its  economy.  Despite  economically  benefiting  from  the  war,  Iceland  received  a  massive  aid  package from the US Marshall Aid Plan.

America became Iceland’s new best friend with a bilateral defence agreement in 1951 and the opening up of the US market for Icelandic seafood products. The US was allocated land for a military base in Keflavik on the Reykjanes Peninsula close to Reykjavik in exchange for defending Iceland against any foreign threat (Ingimundarson, 1996). In a way, Iceland became a client state of the US. Backed by its new ally in the West, Iceland was then able modernize its economy quite rapidly. In its first decade, the military base accounted for up to 20 per cent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings.  The new ally in the West served Iceland well during the so-called Cod Wars (not to be confused with the Cold War) with the British. The dispute was fought in several rounds of confrontation in the 1950s and the 1970s. Iceland had in gradual steps unilaterally expanded its exclusive fishing zone to 200 nautical miles. The first confrontation occurred in 1958 when Iceland  moved  the  zone  from  4  to  12  miles.  Foreign  trawlers,  mainly  British,  which  had  for  decades  been  fishing  close  to  Iceland’s  shores,  were not happy with the move. Initially they ignored the decision of this insignificant, newly independent state and simply continued with their fishing.  After  repeated  incidents  of  ramming  between  Icelandic  patrol  vessels  and  warships  of  the  Royal  British  Navy,  which  had  been  called  in  to  protect  the  British  fishing  trawlers,  an  agreement  was  reached.  The British agreed to move out of the 12-mile zone in exchange for the Icelandic government’s agreement to refer any further expansion to the International Court of Justice in The Hague (Jóhannesson, 2006).  The  second  confrontation  broke  out  in  1972,  when  Iceland  unilat-erally  announced  an  expansion  to  50  nautical  miles.  The  fisheries  minister of the new left-wing government, Lúðvík Jósepsson (PA), justi-fied his decision to abandon the previous agreement of the right-wing government with the UK on the grounds that Iceland not only had the right  but  was  indeed  obligated  to  protect  its  economic  independence  (Jósepsson,  1973).  Despite  Iceland’s  decision,  British  trawlers  kept  on  fishing  within  the  50-mile  zone.  Our  small  coastguard  responded  by  cutting the fishing nets from behind the British trawlers with specially designed  scissors,  which  were  attached  to  the  patrol  ships.  Again  the  British Royal Navy sailed into Iceland’s waters to protect their trawlers, escalating the dispute. Again repeated ramming of Icelandic ships and British  tugboats,  warships  and  trawlers  occurred.  It  served  Iceland’s  interests that this confrontation between two NATO states at the height of the Cold War was thought to weaken the organization. Its Secretary General,  Joseph  Luns,  was  subsequently  able  to  broker  an  agreement  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":49,"content":"Coming of Age – Economic History 37whereby the fishing of British trawlers within Iceland’s 50-mile zone was limited to a small area.  A few years later, the hardest-fought confrontation of the three Cod Wars broke out when Iceland announced an expansion to 200 miles in 1975. As before, the British trawlers refused to leave. The Icelandic coast-guard  thus  resumed  cutting  their  fishing  nets,  separating  the  trawlers  from their catch. The British Navy could of course have sunk the entire Icelandic coastguard in a single battle and thus allowed their trawlers to continue bringing back home cod for British fish and chips. In total the  British  Navy  deployed  22  frigates,  7  supply  ships,  9  tugboats  and  3 support ships to protect its fishing boats within 200 miles of Iceland’s coastline.  The  Icelandic  coastguard,  on  the  other  hand,  consisted  of  just  four  patrol  vessels  and  two  lightly  armed  trawlers  (Jóhannesson,  2006).  The UK’s massive military might was met with Iceland’s new geos-trategic  importance  in  the  Cold  War.  By  threatening  to  leave  NATO  and  close  its  military  base  in  Keflavik,  thus  opening  up  the  North-West  Atlantic  to  the  Soviets,  the  Icelandic  government  was  able  to  exploit  its  newly  established  Washington  connection  to  put  pres-sure  on  Westminster.  Backed  by  US  diplomacy  Iceland  was  able  in  1976 to drive British trawlers out of the 200-mile fishing zone. Later, US  Secretary  of  State  Henry  Kissinger  described  Iceland’s  behaviour  as arrogant and its use of its geostrategic position as the ‘tyranny of the tiny’. UK fishing towns like Hull and Grimsby were subsequently left  in  economic  ruin.  Only  in  2012,  35  years  later,  did  the  British  government compensate for their loss, with an apology and a thou-sand-pound donation to each of the 2,500 fishermen who lost their livelihood (Drainey, 2012).  In Icelandic political discourse the Cod Wars are viewed as a contin-uation  of  Iceland’s  eternal  independence  struggle,  this  time  as  a  fight  for  its  economic  independence  against  a  foreign  authority  that  had  for  more  than  a  century  exploited  its  natural  resources.  The  captains  of the patrol vessels became national heroes and have been household names ever since. The goal was to gain control over the fishing resources surrounding the country. Since independence, the fishing industry has been the most important sector of the economy and the foundation of Iceland’s economic independence. Because of this importance a charac-teristics of an postcolonial relationship developed between Iceland and the  UK  during  the  Cod  Wars,  which  in  2008  was  to  reappear  in  the  dispute over the Icesave deposit accounts.

Like its Nordic neighbours  (see  Katzenstein,  1985)  Iceland  sought  economic  progress  during this period through a heavily export-dependent regime of accu-mulation  based  on  its  rich  but  narrow  range  of  natural  resources  by  generating  growth  through  the  accumulation  of  foreign  exchange.  In  the wake of the Cod Wars the fast growing fishing companies renewed their  fleet,  buying  many  new  high-tech  trawlers.  Fisheries  became  the  engine room of Iceland’s economy, generating the bulk of the country’s foreign income and ensuring rapid growth throughout the 20th century. Around them a prosperous support industry developed.  Iceland’s  size  and  remoteness  nevertheless  reduced  its  structural  capacity to pursue the type of accumulation strategies aimed at industri-alization and diversification that had been adopted by the other Nordic countries (Mjøset, 1987). Instead, the Icelandic regime of accumulation continued to focus on the expansion of the workforce, mainly through feminization and urbanization. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, labour force participation was amongst the highest in Europe, with an unemployment rate averaging around 2 per cent. At the same time,  the  value  of  the  fishing  industry  was  increasing  through  the  expansion of fishing limits and the trawler fleet. These structural limita-tions also translated into, and were reinforced by, the skills base, state bureaucracy and infrastructure, as well as exclusion from value chains, limited incentives for foreign direct investment and a tendency towards monopolistic  or  oligopolistic  ownership  structures  (Jónsson,  1991).  Despite food and staple goods being relatively disadvantaged under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), fungible fish products generated high profits. Continuity of demand was also ensured by the large NATO base in Keflavik.  Thanks to the vast expansion of the exclusive fishing zone during the Cod  Wars,  the  fishing  sector  grew,  which  accelerated  foreign  income.  Foreign currency was now flowing into the country, causing increased inflation,  in  the  range  of  30  to  50  per  cent  annually.  Indeed,  fishing  provided the only export industry of importance, constituting roughly 90 per cent of all merchandise exports in the early 1960s, and became the  engine  of  the  Icelandic  growth  model,  which  grew  annually  by  around 4 per cent on average for the rest of the century. However, the ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":51,"content":"Coming of Age – Economic History 39profit  generated  was  hugely  affected  by  unpredictable  fluctuations  in  the annual size of harvests.  Translated  into  labour  market  relations,  Iceland’s  insertion  into  the  world  economy  played  into  the  hands  of  fisheries  capital.  Soon  the  government’s  economic  policy  was  being  dictated  by  the  interest  of  the fishing industry, which demanded protection against its volatility. Subsequently, monetary policy came to serve the interest of the sector, which generated the country’s foreign income. The exchange rate was tuned to the export needs of the fisheries, with repeated devaluation of the króna, which often spurred inflation. The population in effect came to  live  on  a  share-of-the-catch  income  (Jónsson,  2009:  37).  Economic  development thus suffered from a ‘Dutch disease’ as most public deci-sions were skewed in favour of the fishing industry.  Paradoxically, although the labour movement had grown large during the  early  stage  of  capitalism  and  did,  for  instance,  engage  in  collec-tive  wage  bargaining  and  successfully  defend  full  employment,  it  was  fragmented  and  its  interests  were  ineffectively  channelled  into  parlia-mentary  politics.  Indeed,  the  labour  movement  never  succeeded  in  establishing  common  ground  with  employers,  which  could  serve  as  the foundation for relatively peaceful labour relations, as, for example, in  Sweden.  Emerging  partly  in  response  to  the  political  weakness  of  industrial capital, the Independence Party took advantage of this frag-mentation by representing itself as defending the interests of industry more  broadly,  for  example  by  infiltrating  the  ASI  and  by  influencing  its various organizations through interlocking networks of kinship and ownership (Baldvinsdóttir, 1998).  The IP combined demands for a laissez-faire economy, in opposition to  socialism  and  co-operatives,  with  demands  for  law  and  order  often  couched  in  nationalist  discourse.  To  disguise  its  class  allegiances,  the  party  claimed  to  harmoniously  represent  all  classes,  captured  discur-sively  by  its  slogan  ‘class  with  class’  (  stétt  með  stétt )  and  practically  by  its  commitment  to  full  employment  through  highly  accommodating  monetary policies (Kristjánsson, 1977). As a consequence of this paradox, the labour movement was never able to push for any compromise-based incomes policy, which could have enabled the reinvestment of profits into labour and technology to ensure social protection and competitive-ness. Iceland’s construction of a comprehensive and universalist welfare state unfolded at best unevenly during the period and was able neither to provide effective wage protection against the effects of small annual harvests, nor to reduce inequality (Ólafsson, 2005; Mjøset, 1987).

The  destabilization  of  international  monetary  relations  and  price  levels  in  the  late  1960s  put  significant  external  pressure  on  national  economies.  Food  prices  surged  and  hence  the  prices  of  and  profits  from  the  sale  of  Icelandic  fish  products.  In  accordance  with  the  infla-tionary procyclicality of the Icelandic growth model, the resulting profit surge was not effectively channelled into productive investments, thus preventing excessive inflationary pressure, but was rather used to offset growing  (albeit  not  internationally  deviating)  wage  demands.  This  became  a  fundamental  problem  for  the  growth  model  once  demand  stagnated and fishing stocks collapsed in the 1970s. Governments from across the political spectrum were troubled in dealing with this inherent weakness in the growth model.  Social   Democratic   participation   in   government   contributed   to   the  introduction  of  wage  indexation,  which  resulted  in  wages  partly  following  profit  rates.  Although  labour  market  conflict  was  avoided,  public  indebtedness  and  inflation  kept  on  growing.  With  the  subse-quent  OPEC  oil  shock  in  1973,  stagflationary  pressures  in  the  world  economy drove both government and justificatory regime into disarray as demand for fish products slumped. Profit rates fell, public indebted-ness grew and inflation once again shot up. The government responded to  demands  from  fisheries  capital  to  defend  profit  rates  by  dropping  wage indexation and repeatedly devaluing the króna to strengthen the distribution  of  income  transfers  towards  the  fisheries  sector  (Mjøset,  1987). The government, however, failed to reverse the accommodating monetary policies, with public indebtedness and inflation shooting up as a consequence in the 1970s. As the subsequent (uneven) resumption of growth in the economy, benefitting the fisheries sector in particular, was  understood  to  come  on  the  back  of  unfair  income  transfers,  an  unprecedented  wave  of  strikes  hit  the  country,  lasting  from  1974  to  1977. Radical dissent against this  rentier  capitalism (Gylfason, 2006) as well as the societal paradigm underpinning it resulted in unprecedented support for the SDP and the more radical leftist People’s Alliance in the 1978 elections.  Inflation had been upsetting the economy throughout most of the century and causing great difficulties. During the inflationary period of  the  1970s  and  1980s  real  interest  rates  were  kept  negative  as  the  nominal  rate  was  kept  below  a  fixed  ceiling.  Loans  were  thus  tanta-mount to gifts, which the government-controlled banks handed out to  those  the  ruling  class  deemed  worthy.

Consequently,  saving  fell  and  deposit  instal-ments  shrank  (Halldórsson  &  Zoega,  2010).  This  was  an  unsustain-able financial system. As a part of a broad-based economic reform this led  the  government  in  1979  to  introduce  an  innovative  mechanism  of inflation indexation on bank loans, which soon became standard in  bank  lending.  Housing  loan  borrowers  were  to  pay  a  fixed  real  interest  rate  but  hikes  in  inflation  would  be  accumulated  on  top  of  the nominal interest rate onto the principal, which as a result would grow with inflation throughout the maturity of the loan. As a result, the lion’s share of bank loans in the system would gradually become immune  to  changes  in  short-term  policy  rates,  the  main  monetary  tool of the Central Bank. The equity of households, however, became immensely  sensitive  to  inflation,  in  effect  turning  almost  the  entire  population  into  venture  capitalists.  This  practice  severely  punished  the ordinary person in The Crash of 2008, when the currency tanked, spurring rampant inflation and dumping many households into nega-tive equity.    ITQ and neoliberal modernization  In  the  midst  of  crisis  of  the  late  1970s,  Iceland  entered  a  moment  of  selection between competing economic models. Within the IP a genera-tional shift was occurring and young neoliberals rose through the ranks around  the  journal    The  Locomotive   (Eimreiðin).  Inspired  by  the  liber-tarian and monetarist currents of the time, their articulation of a neolib-eral economic imaginary to substantially modernize the failing growth model  and  justificatory  regime  became  increasingly  influential  in  the  Icelandic  economy.  Influenced  by  neoliberal  economists  like  Friedrich  von  Hayek,  Milton  Friedman  and  James  M.  Buchanan,  who  all  visited  the  country  in  the  1980s,  Icelandic  capital  accumulation  was  to  be  re-co-ordinated   according   to   financial   market   norms   and   values.   Interestingly,  this  is  when  neoliberal  financialization  also  started  in  Greece (Foukas & Dimoulas, 2013) and in Ireland (Kirby, 2010), which were to compare to Iceland in the contemporary financial crisis.  With  the  old  regime  undermined,  the  young  neoliberals  sought  to  introduce  a  largely  new  set  of  tests  to  support  a  neoliberal  accumu-lation  strategy.  IP  governments  after  the  1983  elections  were  signifi-cantly  influenced  by  the  Locomotive  Group’s  ideas,  and  set  out  first  and  foremost  to  fight  inflation  through  raising  interest  rates  and  weakening  special  interests,  particularly  labour.  Devaluing  the  króna  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":54,"content":"42   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisas  a  regulatory  mechanism  was  now  deemed  unacceptable.  Strong  private  property  rights  had  to  be  introduced  as  they  were  argued  to  provide incentives for efficient market behaviour, which in turn would bring  about  fair  outcomes.  Central  to  the  formulation  of  this  accu-mulation  strategy  was  the  neoliberal  modernization  of  the  fisheries  sector through the introduction of the regulatory system of Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ).  After the Cod Wars the fishing industry had grown rapidly with ever increasing  numbers  of  fishing  vessels  and  the  introduction  of  techno-logical  advancements  in  fishing.  Initially,  this  led  to  greater  value  for  export but gradually also to massive overfishing. By the late 1980s it was clear that the catch had to be restricted. The right-of-centre government decided to introduce a quota system based on dividing the total allow-able catch between fish vessel owners and the transfer of fishing rights on the free market. The government simply decided to hand the fishing rights to those fishing vessel owners who had utilized the stock in the few previous years – turning others away empty handed and instantly creating  massive  equity  for  those  lucky  enough  to  have  been  fishing  in  Icelandic  waters  in  the  relevant  years.  All  of  a  sudden,  they  could  freely trade the fishing rights, though formally not their private prop-erty. This decision was founded on the idea that fishing rights ‘should be developed as far as possible into a system of private property rights’ (Gissurarson, 2000).  While  the  shift  to  the  Viking  finance-dominated  regime  of  accu-mulation  was  not  made  until  the  subsequent  period,  as  I  will  discuss  in  Chapter  4,  the  introduction  of  the  ITQ  system  was  crucial  to  the  emergence of this regime. This came through a series of shock-therapy reforms between 1977 and 1991. Controversially, by turning uncaught fish and their ‘production’ into property based on historical catch levels, the very right to produce and all its derivatives were made tradable. At the same time as it was intended to do away with overfishing, this was supposed  to  incentivize  optimal  efficiency  in  the  fisheries  sector.  This  was perfectly in line with the neoliberal economic imaginary of breaking the boom-and-bust nature of the fisheries cycle by engineering produc-tive efficiency in the fisheries sector through market mechanisms. While open  in  the  abstract  (Gissurarson,  2000),  the  ITQ  system  came  to  be  designed  so  as  to  institutionalize  the  market  power  of  the  ‘giants’  in  the Icelandic fisheries sector, further creating opportunities for fisheries capital to separate ownership from actual fishing through the construc-tion of a leasing system. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":55,"content":"Coming of Age – Economic History 43 Opposition to the ITQ system grew and generated a number of trials of strength. First, the market mechanisms, including that of a lease system, set in motion by the ITQ system were criticized for fundamentally trans-forming  the  power  distribution  in  production  relations  to  the  benefit  of fisheries capital. Equal wage formation across the fisheries sector was fundamentally  undermined  as  wages  became  increasingly  determined  by  market  prices  of  different  fish,  size  of  annual  catch,  trade  quotas  and  oil  prices.  A  key  counter  criticism  here  was  that  the  inflationary  production relations of old required a shake-up as labour power in the old growth regime had led to constant wage pressures across the sector with uncontrolled expansion of production and eventual overfishing as outcomes.  Second, the distribution of quotas on the basis of catch history was criticized. This related to the principle of distribution, which allocated quotas to vessel owners rather than to fishermen. Fishing rights, it was argued, were ‘traditionally the birth right of all Icelanders, but would now be inherited by the holders’ descendants like any other privately owned  item’  (Helgason  &  Palsson,  1997).  Third,  there  was  the  criti-cism of fisheries capital for its blind pursuit of profit. Specifically, to seek  to  profit  from  the  commodification  of  a  natural  resource,  not  least such a central one as fish, was deemed immoral. However, partly mitigating  these  criticisms  was  the  SDP’s  insistence  upon  the  inser-tion of the first article in the Fisheries Management Act, stating that the  fish  stocks  are  ‘the  common  property’  of  the  Icelandic  nation  (Gissurarson, 2000).  Introducing ITQ did not instantly correct the long lasing over fishing, leading to a collapse of the cod stock in 1989, which resulted in a serious blow  to  the  economy.  The  government  responded  by  devaluating  the  króna  while  freezing  salaries,  which  led  inflation  to  shoot  up  and  purchasing power to plunge. Once again the economy had fallen into recession after overheating. In an attempt at promoting stability in this crisis-ridden economy, the left-of-centre government led by the PP was in early 1990 able to negotiate a historic neo-corporatist agreement with most  labour  market  stakeholders,  including  all  major  employers  and  labour  unions  (Macheda,  2012).  This  ‘National  Consensus  Agreement’  ( Þjóðarsáttin )  ended  bitter  labour  market  disputes,  which  were  marked  by unrest and frequent strikes. The main aim was to break the vicious cycle of wage increases eaten up by inflation. The agreement laid a new foundation for a long-lasting peace in the labour market and paved the way for the economy to take off a few years later.

It  was  connected  with  interna-tional financial markets at the beginning of the century by the establish-ment  of  Íslandsbanki.  The  inflow  of  foreign  cash  had  a  revolutionary  effect,  leading  to  fast  industrialization  and  the  creation  of  a  modern-ized  economy  based  on  fishing.  Iceland’s  economy  was  thus  based  on  a  fragile  model  of  monosectoral  production.  With  the  collapse  of  the  old  Íslandsbanki,  Iceland’s  financial  system  was  nationalized  and  in  effect  moved  out  of  international  markets  with  the  introduction  of  capital controls in 1931. There was thus no banking tradition to speak of when international financial markets opened again in 1994, more than 60 years later.  Despite  the  inflow  of  foreign  currency,  mainly  into  the  fisheries  sector, Icelandic society and the rest of the economy remained relatively isolated until the landing of the British and American militaries during the Second World War. The war rushed Iceland into modernization and pushed us into a strategic position in the Cold War, which we were able exploit to advance the economy.  The  volatility  of  the  fishing  industry,  resulting  in  ongoing  cycles  of  boom  and  bust,  spurred  in  the  latter  half  of  the  20th  century  a  strive for diversification – which is often lacking in small states that are more reliant on trade than larger states (for more, see Cooper & Shaw, 2009). With the utilization of natural resources such as water-falls  and  geothermal  energy,  power  production  was  taking  off  and  it  eventually  emerged  as  another  significant  pillar  of  the  economy.  The first aluminium smelters were built in the 1960s. By the end of the century, Iceland produced 4 per cent of the world’s aluminium. Tourism was also growing, by nearly 7 per cent a year, and gradually emerging as the third pillar of Iceland’s economy. By the end of 20th century,  Iceland’s  economy  had  thus  been  transformed.  Within  a  single century Iceland had been turned from a poor, backward, medi-eval society into one of the most vibrant and prosperous economies in  the  world.  In  1904  our  purchasing  power  was  similar  to  that  of  Ghana today. By the end of the century we had surpassed Denmark, growing by an average of 2.6 per cent a year throughout the century (Halldórsson & Zoega, 2010).  Icelanders  had  modernized  faster  than  perhaps  any  other  people.  Through  internationalization  and  diversification  we  had  jumped  to  the top of the international ranking of the fastest growing economies.

In  this  chapter  I  analyse  how  post-imperialism  shapes  Iceland’s  foreign  relations.  As  described  in  Chapter  1,  Iceland’s  national  identity  created  a  dilemma  between  emphasis  on  self-rule  and  thus  isolationism  in  foreign  relations  on  the  one  hand  and  participation  in  international  relations  in  order  to  support its claim for recognition as a European partner on the other. As I will illustrate, the legacy of the independence struggle still directs the discourse Icelandic politicians use in the debate on foreign relations. A strong emphasis on sovereignty has become the foundation on which Icelandic politics rests. Participation in European Union supra-national institutions, for example, falls rather outside the framework of Icelandic political  discourse,  which  highlights  Iceland’s  sovereignty  and  stresses  an everlasting independence struggle.  Leading  up  to  The  Crash,  pressure  to  adopt  the  euro  to  replace  the  small  and  volatile  Icelandic  króna  had,  however,  been  building.  The  oversized  Icelandic  banks  were  operating  in  a  market  that  included  500  million  people  but  with  a  currency  and  a  Central  Bank  that  was  backed  up  by  only  roughly  330,000  inhabitants.  Still,  rather  than  proposing  full  membership  of  the  EU  and  the  EMU,  many  politicians  started  to  entertain  the  idea  that  Iceland  might  unilaterally  adopt  the  euro  without  membership  of  the  EU.  That  approach  fits  in  with  the  current relationship Iceland has with the European integration process, namely participating actively but not being a formal part of EU institu-tions, with the apparent loss of formal sovereignty that entails.  Until  the  collapse  of  the  banking  system,  Iceland  was  in  no  hurry  to  join  the  EU  and  seemed  quite  happy  with  its  de  facto  membership        3   The Independent State – Foreign Relations   ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":59,"content":"The Independent State – Foreign Relations 47through the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, which brought it into the Single European Market without representation in EU institu-tions. The collapse of the currency alongside with the financial system, however,  created  a  new  urgency  for  the  government  to  apply  for  EU  membership.  The  lure  of  the  euro  was  splitting  the  population  down  the usual political line: between  internationalists  and  isolationists.  Iceland was the last of the fully functioning sovereign states in Western Europe to  apply  for  membership  of  the  European  Union.  It  took  a  complete  meltdown  of  the  whole  banking  industry  to  bring  the  question  of  possible  EU  membership  back  onto  the  political  agenda.  Even  though  Iceland was facing its biggest recession in modern times, the EU debate was fiercely fought. In fact, it shook the whole political landscape. On the surface, the debate revolved around two main factors: the benefits of the euro and the inconvenience of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Under the surface, however, lay good old nationalism. Not in the clas-sical sense, but rather a special understanding of Iceland’s sovereignty as discussed in Chapter 1.    Three pillars  Iceland’s  foreign  relations  are  supported  by  three  main  pillars:  the  European  pillar,  the  Atlantic  pillar  and  the  rest-of-the-world  pillar  (Bergmann, 2007). The European pillar is by far the most important and contains  most  of  the  country’s  major  trade  agreements  and  the  vital  foreign links that underpin the economy, such as its membership in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the EEA Agreement. Iceland is also a member of the Council of Europe and is firmly rooted within the heritage of Nordic co-operation. Here we can also mention the close bilateral  trade  and  cultural  relationship  with  the  UK.  Ever  since  the  Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 Icelanders have debated their place in  Europe.  Directly  resulting  from  the  heritage  of  the  independence  struggle,  debates  on  foreign  relations  have  become  more  acrimonious  than almost any other political disputes in the country (Ingimundarson, 1996; Bergmann, 2011a). Iceland joined EFTA in 1970, a decade after it was established, and entered with its EFTA partners into the EEA in 1994, which resulted in its becoming a kind of de facto member of the EU.  The  Atlantic  pillar  is  the  second  most  important  and  comprises  the  founding  membership  of  NATO  in  1949  and  the  defence  agreement  with the US since 1951, which resulted in a close bilateral relationship with  Washington  on  foreign  policy  matters.

This feeling of unity was shattered only a few years later when a fierce debate on membership of NATO arose and culminated in violent riots in front of the Parliament building.  While  Iceland  mostly  relied  on  the  European  pillar  to  underpin  its  economy, it relied much more heavily on the Atlantic pillar for its stra-tegic  security.  After  the  US  government  decided  to  close  its  army  base  in  Keflavik  in  2006,  the  Atlantic  pillar,  however,  became  less  impor-tant  than  before,  giving  more  weight  to  the  European  co-operation  in  foreign  and  security  policy  matters  in  addition  to  the  economic  co-operation. The third pillar consists of foreign relations with the rest of  the  world,  for  example  through  the  United  Nations  and  the  World  Trade Organization.  Political science professor Baldur Thorhallsson (2009) maintains that since  1990  Iceland  has  become  more  active  and  more  ambitious  in  international  co-operation,  no  longer  focusing  only  on  bilateral  rela-tionships  but  also  fostering  more  complex  multilateral  relationships.  Still,  although  such  a  shift  may  indeed  have  taken  place,  Iceland  was  not prepared to join the EU, resulting in a more ambiguous position in foreign relations when the crisis hit.    Outside in Europe  Mainly  on  the  grounds  of  guarding  its  sovereignty,  after  having  strug-gled for independence from Denmark for more than a century, Iceland has  remained  outside  the  European  Union.  Independence  and  formal  sovereignty  are  then  almost  synonymous  with    democracy   in  Icelandic  public debate.  Economically, however, Iceland feels the same need as other European states  to  participate  in  European  co-operation,  which  can  explain  its  membership  in  the  European  Economic  Area  agreement  (EEA).  The  agreement has brought Iceland into the Single European Market, but at a cost: Iceland has de facto agreed to adopt the EU’s legislation within the boundaries of the agreement, and thus to a transfer of decision making and domestic governmental power to the EU. Through the EEA Iceland adopts  three-quarters  of  EU  laws  (Europautredningen,  2012)  and  close  to one-fifth of all laws passed in the Icelandic parliament derives from the EU – which is a higher percentage than in many EU member state (Bergmann, 2011b).

Only after the collapse of the country’s entire financial system in 2008 did  the  new  left-wing  government  apply  for  EU  membership,  in  July  2009 – the very last of the Nordic five. This was in many ways a response to the fundamental systemic flaw in the economic set-up Iceland found itself in being an active participant in the European internal market but without the collective back-up that would come from being a full and formal member of the EU’s institutions and political machinery: Iceland had become a participant in a vast legal framework without due demo-cratic representation. In some respects, Iceland’s financial crisis threw it out of its comfort zone and forced it to face the flawed situation it found itself  in  within  the  European  integration  process.  However,  soon  after  the  initial  shock  had  calmed,  opposition  to  membership  rose  again,  even beyond previous levels. Opinion polls indicated increased opposi-tion  to  the  accession  negotiations,  more  than  two-thirds  of  Icelanders  saying  that  they  would  refuse  membership  in  a  referendum  (Samtök  Iðnaðarins,  2013).  This  allowed  the  new  right-of-centre  coalition  to  freeze the negotiations after the April 2013 parliamentary elections.    Challenges  To understand the approach to Europe it is important to note that even though Iceland formally remained outside the EU it was still an active participant in European integration. In fact, Iceland was in some ways more deeply involved in the European integration process than some of the EU’s official members. To name a few examples, Denmark had many formal opt-outs from the EU treaties that Iceland was subject to through the EEA, and the EU’s border regulation was applied in Iceland through the Schengen agreement, while the UK and Ireland were exempted from that part of EU co-operation (Adler-Nissen, 2008).  The EEA has facilitated the active Europeanization of Iceland, bringing it into the Single Market in return for its agreement to adopt the regu-latory  framework  of  the  European  Union.  The  agreement  calls  for  the  constant revision and update of Icelandic law to ensure that the country is in line with European laws and regulations (for more, see Bergmann, 2011b). We are thus very deeply involved in the European project and excluded from very few areas. In certain matters, such as those relating ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":62,"content":"50   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisto  the  environment,  transport  and  food  hygiene,  the  vast  majority  of  the  legislation  passed  in  the  Icelandic  parliament  is  initiated  through  the EEA. Furthermore, the border between what is considered part of the Single Market (and therefore what is considered EEA-relevant) and other aspects of EU legislation is becoming increasingly blurred.  The agreement does not, however, provide access to the EU’s institu-tions and decision-making processes. It also does not cover the Common Agricultural  Policy  and  regional  cohesion  policies  and,  perhaps  most  importantly  for  Iceland,  it  does  not  include  the  Common  Fisheries  Policy. We do not participate in the EU’s trade policy, monetary policy, tax  regimes  or  foreign  affairs,  nor  many  of  the  EU’s  internal  policies,  including  judiciary  affairs  that  fall  outside  the  Schengen  and  Dublin  Agreements.  The EEA has facilitated the transformation of the Icelandic economy, which has not only grown rapidly but also become more diversified and internationalized. However, despite the obvious economic benefits, the EEA Agreement has also presented grave challenges to the tiny economy and, more importantly, to our cherished democracy.  Despite  Iceland’s,  Norway’s  and  Liechtenstein’s  formal  equality  in  the institutional framework, it has always been clear that the EU is the dominant  partner.  As  a  result,  the  automatic  implementation  of  EU  legislation is rarely discussed in the  Alþingi  as the EFTA’s cannot refuse EU legislation without threatening the whole arrangement. Vetoing EU legislation could lead to dismissal from the EEA Agreement, not only for the individual state, but also for its two other EEA EFTA partners. Often referred  to  as  the    nuclear  bomb  clause ,  the  formal  veto  right  might  be  effective, but perhaps not to anyone’s benefit if it was used.  Entering the Single European Market altered the composition of the Icelandic economy, for example by opening up the international finan-cial market. It also, however, created a new vulnerability, which became evident  in  the  2008  financial  crisis.  After  privatization  and  extensive  deregulation,  the  Icelandic  banks  grew  rapidly  on  European  markets  and  well  beyond  our  capability  to  bail  them  out  when  the  crisis  hit,  as  will  be  discussed  further  in  the  following  chapters.  The  Depositors’  Guarantee Fund, set up on the basis of a European directive, never had enough funding to cover a systemic collapse and no help came from the European  institutions,  which  Iceland  was  not  part  of.  This    neither-in-nor-out  arrangement – with one foot in on the Single European Market, with all the obligations that entailed, and the other foot outside the EU institutions, and therefore without access to back-up from, for example, ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":63,"content":"The Independent State – Foreign Relations 51the European Central Bank – proved to be flawed when the country was faced with a crisis of this magnitude.  The emphasis on formal sovereignty but active practical participation in the European market had left us without the safety net that the euro and other institutional mechanisms bring to EU members. So when the international financial crisis hit Iceland, not only did the country’s over-sized  banks  come  crashing  down,  but  the  króna  instantly  went  in  to  free-fall, with devastating effects on the general public.  Even  though  the  EEA  is  dynamic,  it  does  not  respond  to  the  opera-tional  and  institutional  changes  of  the  EU.  Since  the  1992  Maastricht  Treaty,  various  political  shifts  and  institutional  turns  have  altered  the  EU, meaning that the political and legal environment in which the EEA operates has changed dramatically. With only Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway representing EFTA, while the EU has grown to 28 Member States with a total of around 500 million inhabitants, the influence of the EFTA countries within the EEA has diminished significantly. Icelandic officials working  in  the  field  are  convinced  that  the  EEA  is  becoming  decreas-ingly important to the EU and has thus been relegated to a status lower than it enjoyed previously.    Compensating for smallness  Although  it  has  grown  from  a  population  of  around  60,000  in  the  mid-19th  century  to  roughly  330,000  at  present,  Iceland  still  borders  on  being  a  microstate.  As  a  result,  Iceland  can  operate  only  a  much  smaller  administration  than  most  of  its  counterparts  within  EFTA  and  the  EU.  Only  roughly  a  hundred  diplomats  are  working  in  the  entire  Foreign  Service.  Because  of  this  systemic  lack  of  resources,  Iceland  has  been  forced  to  focus  much  more  actively  on  specific  policy  areas  (Thorhallsson, 2000).  Smallness compels external co-operation (Cooper & Shaw, 2009). To compensate  for  its  smallness  Iceland  relies  on  close  co-operation  with  its neighbours and even outsources some of its state duties (for example, strategic  security)  to  Washington  and  part  of  its  legislation  to  Brussels  through  the  EEA.  In  this  regard,  the  foreign  services  of  neighbouring  states,  especially  the  other  Nordics  and  most  frequently  Denmark  and  Norway, become a strategic source of information and assistance. This is a strategic game by a small administration to gain access to information and  background  analysis  that  requires  greater  manpower  than  Iceland  has to call on.

Senior diplomats in Iceland’s Foreign Service claim that their Norwegian counterparts seem to forget on occasion that they are in a binding agreement with two smaller partners (Bergmann, 2011b). Norway, as the largest EEA power within EFTA, tends to operate alone on issues that are of concern to all three of them. The two coun-tries have often operated quite different European policies. It is claimed that,  since  the  Norwegian  people  have  twice  refused  to  accede  to  the  EU,  the  Norwegian  government  is  very  concerned  with  proving  itself  to be ‘a good European’. Iceland, on the other hand, has never felt the need to gain that kind of approval in Brussels. As a result, the Icelandic government feels that Norway is keen to give in to the demands of the EU, rather than sticking firmly to the principles of the EEA Agreement and, indeed, the EFTA Convention (Bergmann, 2011b).  The relationship between Iceland and Norway in the EEA can perhaps be  compared  to  an  arranged  marriage  between  distant  cousins.  This  is  not a relationship entered into on the basis of true love; there is, instead, an  uneven  balance  of  power  and  ongoing  and  unresolved  tensions  between  the  two  parties,  which  are  exacerbated  by  the  obligation  to  make it work.    Iceland’s sense of sovereignty  Rationalist   International   Relations   (IR)   scholars   have   explained   Iceland’s  hesitance  to  join  the  EU  mainly  in  terms  of  the  inter-ests  of  the  fishing  sector,  which  claims  that  the  EU  Fisheries  Policy  contradicts  Iceland’s  economic  interest  (Ingebritsen,  2000).  This  can,  however,  be  questioned  by  referring  to  the  fact  that  until  the  profound  economic  collapse  of  2008  a  majority  never  materialized  in  Parliament  to  put  the  fishing  hypothesis  to  the  test  in  accession  negotiations with the EU. Those parliamentarians otherwise in favour of  seeking  membership  if  the  fisheries  issue  could  be  solved  should  then have been willing to test that in accession negotiations, to see if their concern might be met with adequate opt-outs. Until The Crash of 2008, they were, however, never willing to do that. Combined with the increased opposition the accession negotiations have faced in the wake of the crisis this indicates that other factors might have contrib-uted to Iceland’s anti-EU policy. I thus maintain that problems over the  fishing  issue  is  not  solely  an  economic  argument  but  indeed  a  pivotal  part  of  Iceland’s  post-independence  identity.  The  rationalist  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":65,"content":"The Independent State – Foreign Relations 53approach underestimates the importance of Iceland’s strong national identity, created in the independence struggle. Instead, I argue that to fully  understand  Iceland’s  relationship  with  the  EU  and  its  hesitant  position with regard to the European integration process, it is neces-sary  to  analyse  its  historical  relations,  the  legacy  of  its  colonial  past  and the rhetoric of the independence struggle – which is still central to the Icelandic political discourse.  As  established  in  Chapter  1,  most  students  of  Icelandic  politics  do  acknowledge the importance of the independence struggle on the devel-opment of Iceland’s political identity. Still, the importance of its post-imperial identity has largely been overlooked in established scholarship on Iceland’s EU relations. Kristinsson (2006), for example, only mentions in passing that ‘the word independence strikes a key note in Icelandic political  rhetoric’  before  returning  to  fishing  and  demographic  factors  when  explaining  Iceland’s  EU  relations.  The  interest-based  rationalist  approach  neglects  the  political  effect  of  Iceland’s  postcolonial  iden-tity  and  the  strong  emphasis  on  formal  sovereignty  that  was  created  in  the  independence  struggle.  I  maintain  that  within  the  parameters  of  Iceland’s  national  identity,  EU  membership  is  seen  to  threaten  our  sovereignty and thus the cherished democracy which Icelanders claim can be traced back to the parliamentary court of the settlement society in the year 930: the  Alþingi .  To  study  the  impact  of  national  identity  on  European  integration  policies  we  can  turn  to  Lene  Hansen’s  and  Ole  Wæver’s  (2002)  post-structuralist  framework.  They  show  that  to  understand  what  room  for  manoeuvre governments have in foreign policy it is necessary to study national identities and their impact, for example by analysing domestic political discourse. It is thus helpful to analyse the conceptual constella-tion of the ‘nation’ in studying whether, and how, the idea of participa-tion in European integration can fit within the boundaries of a nation’s political discourse.  The framework claims that when the idea of ‘Europe’ threatens the idea of the ‘nation’ within the domestic debate it becomes difficult to promote further participation in European integration. Thus, the idea of the Icelandic nation and its sovereignty and how that idea fits with Iceland being an integral part of the supra-national European integra-tion  process,  are  as  important  as  –  if  not  more  important  than  –  the  interests  of  the  leading  economic  sector,  fishing,  when  studying  the  relationship  the  nation  has  with  Europe.  Similarly,  Iver  B.  Neumann  (2002) finds that the core concept in Norway’s relationship with Europe is that of ‘the people’ ( folket ), which is tied to national patriotism.

This is significantly contrary to Iceland as a distinction between the ordinary public and an elite is not present in the debate. The Icelandic concept corresponding to  folket  is  þjóðin , which incorporates both the common population and the elite.  According  to  this  model,  it  is  therefore  not  the  personal  conviction  of the participants that is most important, but rather the discourse they apply in the political debate to put their arguments forward – in other words, how they manoeuvre within the domestic language games made possible  and  necessary  by  the  concept  of  sovereignty  under  postcolo-nial conditions. To understand Iceland’s foreign policy and its policy on Europe it is therefore necessary to frame the analysis within the histor-ical context and map how our nation and state-building, which emerged out  of  the  independence  struggle,  impact  on  the  foreign  policy  of  the  present. A historical account is thus needed to provide an understanding of the framework to which contemporary political discourse must relate if it is to make sense. In the following section I thus examine whether and how politicians try to fit participation in European integration with the Icelandic nation’s political discourse, which can be difficult to facili-tate. However, in order to uphold itself as a modern Nordic welfare state, Iceland has an economic need to participate in the EU’s Internal Market, resulting in the EEA Agreement.    The discourses on Europe  In  this  section  I  analyse  the  rhetoric  politicians  use  when  debating  participation  in  European  integration,  focusing  on  its  effect  on  Iceland’s  internal  democracy  and  external  independence.  In  order  to  illustrate  the  continuity  of  the  discourse  and  how  the  nationalist  rhetoric  travels  through  contemporary  politics,  I  will  provide  exam-ples  from  the  main  debates  on  Europe;  first  on  EFTA  (1970),  second  on the EEA Agreement (1994) and third on possible EU membership. As will be discussed in the next chapter, the rhetoric used in foreign relations  during  the  boom  years  leading  up  to  the  collapse  of  the  financial system in autumn 2008 also provides interesting insight into the impact of the national identity discourse, including the postcolo-nial rhetoric and the rhetoric that followed The Crash in connection with the Icesave dispute with the UK and the Dutch government and the involvement of the IMF.

In time of crisis, however, this rhetoric becomes more explicit, as was evident in the Icesave dispute.  Icelandic  politics  revolves  around  a  double  axis:  the  traditional  left/right  axis  and  an  internationalist/isolationist  axis  structured  by  the  issue  of  Iceland’s  sovereignty  in  relation  to  NATO  and  to  European  co-operation. As described before, the party system consists of four main political  parties.  The  left-of-centre  Social  Democratic  Alliance  (SDA)  is  the  only  party  that  has  consistently  campaigned  for  EU  membership.  The right-of-centre Independence Party (IP) supported Iceland’s member-ship of EFTA and the EEA but then turned against EU membership. The leftist  Left  Green  Movement  (LGM)  has  campaigned  against  further  participation in European integration, though recently less aggressively. The  small,  central  Progressive  Party  (PP)  was  for  a  long  time  split  on  the European issue and lacked a clearly defined policy; since the recent change  in  leadership,  however,  the  party  has  turned  ever  more  vigor-ously against EU membership.  When debating EFTA membership (1968–1969), Icelandic parliamen-tarians mostly referred to impact on the economy, as is to be expected considering  that  EFTA  was  a  purely  intergovernmental  organization.  However,  the  narrative  of  the  independence  struggle  and  conservative  ideas on the nation and its sovereignty were always in the background and  formed  in  effect  a  base  for  the  economic  arguments  (Bergmann,  2011a).  Parliamentarians  referred  to  what  they  called  the  undisputed  distinctiveness  of  the  nation  and  said,  for  example,  that  it  was  ‘only  natural that our relationship with EFTA will be marked by that distinc-tiveness’.  1    This  understanding  of  uniqueness  and  distinctiveness  was  then used as an argument for the multiple opt-outs and special solutions which  Iceland  brought  to  the  table  when  negotiating  EFTA  accession.  Those arguing against further participation in the European integration process  feared  a  loss  of  identity  in  such  a  close  relationship  with  the  big  nations  of  Europe.  Directly  tapping  into  the  national  myth,  many  parliamentarians referred to the Old Treaty of 1262 and the introduction of Absolutism in Denmark in 1662 in their argument against integration with other nations.  In the parliamentary debates leading up to the EEA Agreement (1989–1993) the sovereignty argument had moved to the forefront (Bergmann, 2011a).  When  referring  to  economic  benefits,  EEA  advocates  empha-sized  the  aims  of  the  independence  struggle,  progress  and  moderniza-tion, in putting Iceland forward as an equal partner in Europe. Foreign ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":68,"content":"56   Iceland and the International Financial CrisisMinister  Hannibalsson  (SDP)  argued  that  the  EEA  would  be  Iceland’s  ‘passport’ to the future and the key to economic prosperity.  2   He referred to Jón Sigurðsson, the hero of the independence struggle, to support his claim that the EEA was a continuation of the independence struggle and would push Iceland further into modernity.  The sovereignty argument was central to the discourse of the No camp, which  used  it  even  more  systematically  and  forcefully.  They  accused  the  Yes  side  of  being  unpatriotic  and  argued  that  the  EEA  threatened  Iceland’s  sovereignty,  which  would  be  shifted  to  undemocratic  insti-tutions  in  Brussels.  Thus,  Iceland  would  fall  under  foreign  rule  once  again. And even though the agreement would bring economic benefits, it  should  be  rejected  solely  on  the  ground  that  it  violated  Icelanders’  ‘sense  of  sovereignty’.   3    Interestingly,  however,  the  meaning  of  sover-eignty, what it consists of, was hardly discussed. A parliamentarian for the PP emphasized the importance of protecting the purity of Iceland’s identity  and  language,  protecting  it  from  being  contaminated  by  too  intimate foreign relations: ‘if we submit [to the EEA] we would of course instantly lose our language, culture and independence in a very short time.’  4    This  supports  Kristín  Loftsdóttir’s  (2010)  claim  that  Icelanders  continued to associate national identity with purity of the nation and its language.  In the debate on possible EU membership at the beginning of the 2000s, the importance of sovereignty was dominant (Bergmann, 2011a). The No side claimed that the EU’s fisheries policy was not only contrary to our economic interest but also, as one IP parliamentarian maintained, brought with  it  ‘complete  transfer  of  our  nation’s  sovereignty  and  authority’.   5   Iceland’s  national  heritage  and  unique  culture  was  emphasized  when  debating  the  EU’s  fisheries  policy.  It  was  argued  that  Icelanders  should  continue to develop a competitive society and strong economy on their own, claiming that it would be a retrograde step of great consequence if Iceland were to lose its self-rule through membership of the EU. Iceland would  be  locked  inside  an  unproductive  trade  bloc  and  trapped  in  an  undemocratic bureaucracy. At one point, Prime Minister Davíð Oddsson described the EU as one the most undemocratic bureaucratic monstrosity ever  created.  On  the  other  side  of  the  left/right  axis  the  leader  of  the  LGM  similarly  remained  firmly  within  the  boundaries  of  the  postcolo-nial discourse when he said that membership would mean ‘diminished independence and sovereignty, loss of distinctiveness’.  6    Not until after the collapse of the financial system and the ousting of  the  across-the-centre  IP/SDA  coalition  in  the  so-called  Pots  and  Pans  Revolution  of  January  2009  did  the  new  left-wing  government  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":69,"content":"The Independent State – Foreign Relations 57(SDA/LGM)  apply  for  EU  membership.   7    The  Yes  side  tapped  straight  into the postcolonial independence discourse by promoting the EU as a way forward to protect and strengthen Iceland’s sovereignty rather than as a step away from independence, continually referring to Jón Sigurðsson to advance their argument.  Campaigning  against  the  EU,  however,  one  parliamentarian  (IP)  remembered Iceland’s 65th anniversary of independence: ‘We were the poorest  nation  in  Europe  after  600  years  of  co-operation  with  nations  to  the  south  in  Europe  [–  the  same  ones]  we  would  be  joining  now.’   8   In line with the national myth, he explained that Iceland’s misfortune and humiliation had started after the Old Treaty of 1262, and only with independence were we able to become one of the richest nations in the world.  He  concluded  that  with  EU  membership  Iceland  would  again  become a ‘depopulated, poor province in a huge European super-state’. A colleague (IP) said that Icelanders should never forget that they were a  unique  nation,  ‘tough  and  hardworking  and  with  a  soul  that  could  never been broken by foreigners’. One parliamentarian (PP) claimed that  formal  sovereignty ‘makes the nation what she is today’  9  ; another (LGM) that Iceland’s main independence hero, Jón Sigurðsson, ‘would turn in his grave if the EU application went forward’  10  ; and yet another (LGM) feared that the will of the nation would diminish after EU membership and  concluded  that  ‘he  who  is  glad  when  forced  to  obey  becomes  a  slave’.  11    In all of these debates on advancing further into European integration, the  same  tropes  of  the  sovereignty  argument  are  constantly  applied.  When  analysing  this  discourse  it  becomes  evident  that  the  fishing  factor,  central  as  it  has  been,  is  not  only  an  economic  matter  but  also  an  integral  part  of  Iceland’s  sovereignty  discourse  as  developed  in  the  independence struggle. The oft used argument that Iceland cannot join the EU because of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy is therefore not a purely economic argument but a pivotal part of Iceland’s assertion of its post-independence identity. Complete control over the fishing zone is a  symbol  of  the  free  and  independent  Icelandic  nation.  By  extension,  keeping European vessels out of Iceland’s fishing zone is framed as part of the everlasting independence struggle.  It  is  also  noteworthy  that  though  the  discourse  does  indeed  revolve  around protecting Iceland’s ‘formal’ sovereignty, the meaning of sover-eignty is hardly discussed. Hermannsson (2005) argues that even though Icelanders agree on the importance of protecting their sovereignty, they have little common understanding of its meaning and therefore refrain from debating it. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":70,"content":"58   Iceland and the International Financial Crisis The  importance  of  sovereignty  claims,  based  on  Iceland’s  national  identity, came thrusting to the forefront in the debate on the EEA and continued through the debates on possible EU membership. After The Crash  of  2008  and  leading  up  to  the  EU  application  in  summer  2009  the  debate  was  on  both  sides  dominated  by  harsh  nationalistic  rhet-oric, directly stemming from the independence struggle, for example by referring to the uniqueness of the Icelandic nation.  The No side applied this discourse more directly while the Yes side rather  linked  their  economic  argument  with  that  part  of  the  sover-eignty discourse that speaks to modernization and economic progress, arguing  that  further  integration  would  promote  growth  and  thus  ensure Iceland’s economic independence, that gaining free access for Icelandic fish into the Single Market was an indirect continuation of the independence struggle – the EEA thus helping to secure Iceland’s economic  sovereignty.  The  No  side,  on  the  other  hand,  claimed  that  keeping control over the fishing grounds was vital to guarding Iceland’s independence.  However, when digging into the discourse around the impact of EU membership on Icelandic fisheries’ interests, we see how the fisheries argument is itself fuelled by nationalistic rhetoric. In the independence struggle the  peasant  was a symbol of the independent Icelandic nation, but  with  the  increasing  importance  of  fishing,  the    seaman   gradually  took over as the representative of the sovereign Icelandic nation state. Icelanders fought the British in the so-called Cod Wars to gain control over  their  fishing  resources  around  the  country  and  since  independ-ence  the  fishing  industry  has  been  the  most  important  sector  of  the  economy  and  has  surely  been  the  foundation  of  Iceland’s  economic  independence  (Hermannsson,  2005).  The  nation  and  the  seaman  are  for  example  intertwined  in  fishermen’s  folksongs  that  represent  the  patriotic  Icelander  and  have  become  de  facto  national  anthems.  The  fish  in  the  sea  and  the  fisherman  are  in  this  respect  symbols  of  the  independent  Icelandic  nation.  This  is  especially  interesting  in  this  context  as,  in  some  cases  in  the  debate,  the  importance  of  keeping  control  over  fishing  resources  is,  up  to  a  point  at  least,  also  an  inte-gral part of the  everlasting   independence struggle . The oft used argument that Iceland cannot join the EU because of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy is therefore not simply an economic argument but also a vital part  of  Iceland’s  independence  struggle.  Complete  control  over  the  fishing zone becomes in this way a symbol of the free and independent Icelandic nation.

The national myth carved out  in  the  independence  struggle  laid  the  foundation  on  which  the  republic  still  rests  and  set  the  parameters  around  its  political  identity  and for its relation to the EU. The postcolonial political identity put the emphasis on formal sovereignty and contained an insistence on being recognized as an equal partner in Europe, rather than a microstate that relies on a larger metropole. Formal independence is seen as a prerequi-site for a prosperous modern Iceland that enjoys external recognition. This postcolonial identity still characterizes the rhetoric Icelandic politi-cians  use  when  debating  participation  in  European  integration.  It  was  furthermore  very  present  in  the  identity  politics  of  the  boom  years  as  well as in the debate over the Icesave deposit accounts after The Crash, as will be further discussed. Thus, when claiming that the root of Iceland’s Euroscepticism is to be found in economic interests surrounding fishing, rationalist  theorists  neglect  the  importance  of  Iceland’s  postcolonial  identity  in  contemporary  politics,  especially  when  it  comes  to  foreign  relations.  Postcolonial  analyses  have  proven  helpful  in  understanding  how  the  colonial  experience  still  frames  the  discourse  of  Iceland’s  political  economy.  When  analysing  contemporary  political  debates  it  is  thus  important  to  take  into  account  its  historical  context.  In  fact,  our  rela-tionship with the EU only makes sense when we take into account its colonial  history  and  its  postcolonial  national  identity,  which  empha-sizes formal sovereignty. For example, when digging into the role that fishing  plays  in  the  opposition  to  the  EU,  we  see  how  it  is  fuelled  by  nationalistic rhetoric. The rhetoric of the independence struggle travels through different avenues in modern politics.  When analysing the debates on Europe, we clearly see an emphasis on modernization and economic progress. Economically, like other people in  Europe,  Icelanders  felt  a  pressure  to  participate  in  the  European  project,  which  might  explain  our  membership  of  the  EEA  –  which  brought us into the Single European Market. Through the EEA Iceland agreed to transfer decision-making in significant fields of the economy to the European level.  At the same time, however, other forces were pulling in the opposite direction.

In  this  regard,  participation  in  the  EU’s  supra-national  institutions  falls  outside  the  framework  of  established  political  discourse,  which  emphasizes  a  formally  sovereign  and  independent  Icelandic  nation-state,  making  it  more  difficult  for  Icelandic politicians to argue for full and formal membership of a supra-national organization such as the EU. However, for a brief period after The  Crash  of  2008,  a  majority  for  membership  application  emerged,  resulting in an application in mid-2009. Since then, however, opinion polls  have  indicated  a  sharp  decline  in  support,  resulting  in  the  new  right-of-centre government freezing the accession negotiations after the spring 2013 parliamentary elections.  It  is  within  these  boundaries  that  Icelandic  postcolonial  sovereignty  games  are  currently  played.  To  uphold  a  modern  Nordic  welfare  state  recognized as an equal partner in Western culture, Iceland feels the need to  participate  in  the  Single  European  Market,  thus  accepting  the  EEA.  However, formally surrendering to supra-national EU institutions chal-lenges the boundaries of the postcolonial political framework. This can also  be  described  as  a  dilemma  between  economic  interests  and  ideas  on formal sovereignty – illustrating an interesting rift between practical participation in European integration and ideas of a free and sovereign Icelandic nation.  When Iceland handles this dilemma, the relation to the other Nordic countries plays a significant role. Despite the heavy impact of the past colonial relationship with imperial Denmark and Norway on contempo-rary political discourse, Iceland is consistently discursively represented without a foreign metropole. The Nordic states are presented as equals but also serve as a point of reference for Iceland in positioning itself in the world. In diplomatic terms, however, Iceland was still very dependent on  close  co-operation  with,  and  even  help  from,  its  Nordic  counter-parts – and other European states such as Germany. In that regard it is interesting that Iceland was reported to be relying more heavily on Oslo than on Copenhagen; to support the insistence on being recognized as an equal partner, Iceland is keen to distance itself from its most recent metropole. In any case, this dependence on diplomatic assistance from neighbours is somewhat in tension with the emphasis on being capable and self-sufficient.  Iceland’s history and sense of nationhood can be traced back to the Middle Ages, while modern Icelandic society has quite a young aspect to  it.

For a while, the newly established internet company Oz became one of the wealthiest in the country even though we were never really sure of the value of its products.

A fall in fish catch would be met with depreciation of the króna and thus diminished purchasing power of the population. When the króna was finally allowed to float on the free market in 2001, it had lost more than 99 per cent of its value against the Danish krona since the two were separated in 1920. After only seven years of free floating in international waters (2001–2008) the króna collapsed during the finan-cial crisis and was again tied to an anchor behind capital controls.

While economic diversification and higher education were significant elements of this accumulation strategy, for example in the promotion of aluminium, creative and high-tech industries, it centred on the idea of liberating Icelandic capital from the structural constraints of an island economy. The Social Democrats had also been promoting the aggressive internationalization of Icelandic capital. A key move was the attainment of entry into the European internal market by the signing of the European Economic Area agreement, as discussed in the previous chapter. The IP/PP government then, however, sought to prevent the full transnation-alization of Icelandic capital by tying it closely to the Icelandic economy through  monetarist  policies  promoting  a  strong  króna.  Following  the  neo-corporatist pacts of the early 1990s, this accumulation strategy also enjoyed  the  stability  provided  by  a  labour  movement  contingently  in  support  of  a  monetarist  policy  paradigm,  preventing  wage  drift  and  exchange rate fluctuation. As a result, even inflation was brought under control.  The establishment of DeCode Genetics perhaps marks the start of the finanicialization  and  internationalization  of  the  Icelandic  economy.  However  morally  questionable  the  operation,  its  founder,  Dr  Kári  Stefánsson,  was  able  to  secure  support  from  Prime  Minister  Davíð  Oddsson, his old school mate.

Soon,  shares  in  the  company  were trading above US$50 on the black market as many Icelanders mort-gaged their homes to buy into the genealogical adventure. This fitted the Icelandic identity well, as genealogy had been a favourite pastime in the country for centuries – most of us are obsessed with tracing our ances-tries.  In  mid-2000  the  company  was  listed  on  the  NASDAQ.  Its  stock  prices,  however,  collapsed  when  the  tech  bubble  burst  the  following  year,  finally  bottoming  at  around  only  one  dollar  a  share.  Ordinary  Icelanders had gained and lost a great deal of money. In 2012, the rest of the company was finally sold to foreign investors. The story of DeCode was to repeat itself on a much larger scale in the banking bubble, when the  stock  market  multiplied  nine  times  in  value  before  collapsing  in  October 2008.  Surely Iceland had been a prime candidate for a banking crisis. Studies on  the  smaller  Nordic  banking  crisis  in  the  1990s,  for  example,  show  that countries with liberal financial systems are more volatile than those operating  stricter  banking  regulations  (Detragiache  &  Demirgüc-Kunt,  1998). More dramatically, however, this was the first time that a finan-cial system of a modern state had tanked in its entirety. In addition, this was not only a banking crisis but also a currency crisis, a  twin crisis , in Kaminsky and Reinhardt’s (1999) phrase, of broken banks and collapsed currency.    Privatization and deregulation  In the early 1990s, there were few separate banking entities in Iceland. Landsbanki  and  Búnaðarbanki  were  both  state  owned  and  the  new  private  Íslandsbanki  had  been  formed  from  four  smaller  banks  –  one  failed  state  bank  and  three  sectoral  banks  –  each  serving  a  fraction  of  the economy. A network of small savings and loan funds with close ties to municipalities existed as well as a range of public-sector investment funds.  Many  of  these  had  in  the  preceding  years  been  collected  and  merged into a united investment fund, the Icelandic Investment Fund – FBA. Another significant element of the financial system was the private investment  bank  Kaupthing,  established  in  1982  by  eight  individuals.  The  system  was  fragile,  as  most  banks  had  suffered  losses  in  the  1989  mini-crisis and lack of capital and equity limited their manoeuvrability.

The entire banking assets of the country were less than a single year’s GDP, with equity at just over 7 per cent of GDP. Still, before privatization, considerable public financial assets had been building up within the state banks. The pension system had accu-mulated substantial wealth and equity was being generated through the fishing quota system.  Access to foreign capital opened up with Iceland’s entrance into the Single European Market through the EEA in 1994 and privatization of the financial system started in 1998 when the FBA was sold off. Dramatic events surrounding this initial privatization marked the start of the fric-tion between the new business elite and the IP establishment, which was to heighten in the coming years with growing mutual distrust. Against the  will  of  the  government,  young  Jón  Ásgeir  Jóhannesson,  who  was  to lead retail conglomerate Baugur Group, was, together with a collec-tion  of  young  investors,  able  to  gain  control  of  the  investment  bank  FBA.  The  Prime  Minister  openly  voiced  his  fury  over  novice  investors  gaining  control  of  the  bank  instead  of  the  more  established  investors  who  the  government  was  usually  in  business  with.  Consequently,  the  privatization programme of the government was changed. Instead of the state retail banks being sold off to a broad base of investors, as initially planned, to ensure diversified ownership, they would be sold to major shareholders with international backing.  Íslandsbanki  merged  with  the  FBA  in  2000,  increasing  the  power  of  the  new  breed  of  businessman  standing  outside  the  political  elite.  Kaupthing  had  also  been  growing  rapidly  and  was  the  first  to  break  into  international  markets,  opening  an  office  in  Luxembourg  in  1998  which  financed  many  of  Iceland’s  first  aquisitions  abroad.  In  2000,  Kaupthing went public with an initial offering of shares. The state banks were  lagging  behind  in  this  development.  Partial  privatization  had,  however,  already  started  in  1998,  when  limited  shares  in  Landsbanki  and Búnaðarbanki were sold to the public in a broad-based offering. In 2002,  the  government  finally  solicited  bids  on  its  remaining  shares  in  the two main banks. However, in contrast to previous bids and contrary to  the  carefully  orchestrated  governmental  plan  for  privatization,  the  controlling shares would be sold in bulk.  After havoc over the privatization process Landsbanki was sold to the third-highest bidder (Jónsson, 2009: 49), the Samson Group, led by father and  son  Björgólfur  Guðmundsson  and  Björgólfur  Thor  Björgólfsson.  Through  various  Russian  ventures,  they  and  a  third  colleague  had  come  into  money,  eventually  selling  a  beer  factory  in  St  Petersburg  to  Heineken  for  US$400  million.

The then editor of the daily  Morgunblaðið , which is closely tied to the IP, reported that  Prime  Minister  Oddsson  ‘considered  it  necessary  that  Landsbanki  should come into the ownership of people whom the party was at least on speaking terms with’ (Gunnarsson, 2004). It illustrates the closeness of  the  connection  between  IP  and  Landsbanki  that  the  IP’s  Secretary  General, Kjartan Gunnarsson, remained a member of the bank’s board, and even became vice-chairman, after the Samson Group had acquired it. Apart from the Samson Group he held the highest individually owned shares in the bank.  The government’s shares in Búnaðarbanki were sold to the S-group, named after the initial of  Sambandið , the fallen Icelandic Co-operative Movement  discussed  in  Chapter  2.  The  group  was  in  effect  a  coali-tion  of  relatively  new  investors  with  close  ties  to  the  PP,  including  former  Minister  of  Commerce  and  Central  Bank  governor  Finnur  Ingólfsson,  who  had  in  his  previous  capacities  been  instrumental  in  planning  the  privatization.  Apparently  the  S-group  had  presented  a  fake foreign partner to make their offer seem more favourable and to meet  the  terms  of  international  backing  (Hreinsson,  Gunnarsson  &  Benediktsdóttir, 2010).  The privatization of the two major state banks was reportedly a result of a political bargain between the ruling parties. The chief governmental official of the Privatization Committee, Steingrímur Ari Arason, resigned in protest against the government’s involvement in the process, main-taining that the two leaders of the coalition parties, Davíð Oddsson and Halldór  Ásgrímsson,  had  each  hand-picked  the  buyers.  The  report  of  Parliament’s  Special  Investigative  Commission  (SIC)  into  the  events  leading  up  to  The  Crash  states  that  the  bid  criteria  had  been  defined  and  weighted  to  give  the  predicted  results,  that  the  criteria  were  fluid  and  were  repeatedly  relaxed  by  political  decisions.  It  states  that  polit-ical objectives gradually became increasingly dominant before the 2003 sale (ibid.). The IP/PP government thus in effect steered the banks into the  hands  of  politically  chosen  groups  of  investors  with  relative  inex-perience  of  banking.  The  groups  then  formed  a  temporary  alliance  to  finance the deals through cross-investments.  From this opportunist structure resulted what can be understood as a ‘Viking’, finance-dominated regime of accumulation. Rapid privatization and  market  liberalization  presented  Viking  Capitalists  with  the  chance  to exploit the informal and networked bureaucracy that had developed ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":80,"content":"70   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisduring previous accumulation regimes. The goal of the government was to free capital for it to be distributed more broadly through the economy, to promote diversification and to increase growth. One of its main aims was to promote investment by the general public, bringing down interest rates  and  thus  providing  people  with  more  favourable  loans.  Public  authorities were, however, still heavily involved in lending through the governmental Housing Financing Fund and the Student Loan Fund.    Rival groups of Viking Capitalists  Three banking conglomerates emerged out of the almost simultaneous privatization,  deregulation  and  internationalization  of  the  Icelandic  economy,  each  entrenched  in  its  own  power  networks.  This  sector  of  the  economy  was  to  combine  justifications  for  a  Viking,  finance-dominated  regime  of  accumulation  with  criticisms  of  the  monosec-toralism and the cronyism associated with preceding periods to form a new historic bloc deeply embedded in Icelandic society and trans-lating particular interests into a recognized general interest (Overbeek, 2004). Respecting neither traditional power networks nor the rules of the  game,  the  Viking  faction  challenged  the  ‘Octopus’  faction  head  on, both through such criticism and through, frequently hostile, take-overs of key units of ‘Octopus’ conglomerates. Indeed, the emergence of  the  Viking  faction  of  capital  and  the  government’s  promotion  of  a finance-dominated accumulation regime led to intra-class conflict. Yet,  more  widely,  the  growth  of  the  financial  sector  was  welcomed  as it fitted in neatly with the wider aim of diversifying the economy and  breaking  the  boom-and-bust  cycle  of  previous  periods  and  the  exchange  rate  volatility  it  translated  into,  which  had  been  hurting  other sectors.  The  new  breed  of  bankers  was  mostly  led  by  men  in  their  thirties,  many  of  whom  had  studied  together  in  the  Business  Department  at  the  University  of  Iceland  in  Reykjavik  before  leaving  for  MBA  studies  in Europe and America. The older generation of cautious bankers, who prior to privatization had mainly been tied to domestic operations under heavy regulations, was swiftly brushed aside when the young guns broke free of past constrains and stormed international markets. As a result, no institutional memory, tradition or knowledge of international banking was left in the system when the financial bubble started to build.

The  three  rival  groups  each  developed their own identity, which is interesting to explore.   Búnaðarbanki/Kaupthing  When  Búnaðarbanki  was  privatized  in  January  2003,  the  rapidly  growing young investment fund Kaupthing was emerging as the boldest investment bank in the country. Its management consisted of dedicated youngsters led by the slightly older Sigurður Einarsson, who later came to dominate Iceland’s largest bank. The cronies of the PP who acquired Búnaðarbanki had no experience of banking and were thus vulnerable when Kaupthing came asking about a possible merger. The Kaupthing clan  gradually  gained  control  of  the  united  entity,  which  was  initially  named  KB  Bank.  Pension  funds  invested  heavily  in  the  bank,  leading  initially  to  broad  ownership  with  little  control  over  the  management,  which was free to operate at will.  More broadly, involving pension funds in the financing of the banking system  also  served  the  purpose  of  linking  the  potentially  destabilizing  labour movement with the interests of the market world. Rendering the labour movements contingent support necessary was its co-management of  Iceland’s  substantial  occupational  pension  funds,  whose  investment  strategies had come under pressure to embrace portfolio investment strat-egies  to  satisfy  demands  for  high  returns  as  wage-growth  ground  to  a  halt.  The  banking  sector  was  becoming  a  forum  for  overblown  egos.  The  management of Búnaðarbanki had revolved around Sigurjón Árnason, who was believed to be brilliant with numbers but, unlike Einarsson, a micro manager. Árnason would not bow to Einarsson and moved with his  whole  crew  over  to  Landsbanki  before  Einarsson  brought  in  his  tight-knit  cult  of  followers.  A  few  years  later,  when  Einarsson  and  his  team of managers had gained complete control over the merged bank, he  changed  the  name  of  the  united  entity  back  to  Kaupthing.  In  the  following years the management of the bank was able to steer control-ling  shares  of  the  bank  into  the  hands  of  investors  in  and  around  the  Exista holding company. The main owners were tight with the S-group, which still held a large stake in the bank. Exista grew out of Bakkavör, which with the help of Einarsson and his team in Kaupthing had become the leading producer of prepared food in the UK.  Each  year  Kaupthing  had  more  than  doubled  in  size.  It  had  been  upgraded from a small, unrated domestic investment bank to a universal retail bank with A2 rating on international markets.

The aggres-sive  culture  of  high-risk,  fast  decision  making  and  hard  partying  that  had  developed  in  Kaupthing  when  it  was  a  small,  robust  investment  fund in the 1990s spilled over into what was to become Iceland’s largest commercial bank (for more, see Thorvaldsson, 2011).     Landsbanki (and   Straumur)   The return of Björgólfur Guðmundsson to Icelandic business was consid-ered the comeback of the century. After years in exile he not only acquired Landsbanki,  which  he  believed  had  killed  off  this  shipping  company  Hafskip in 1985, but also bought his former main rival, Eimskip, which in 1914 had been partly funded by Icelandic settlers in America in order to  link  Iceland  with  the  outside  world.  Eimskip  became  all  but  sacred  in  Iceland  as  it  was  believed  to  be  instrumental  in  its  independence.  Guðmundsson went on to buy into many of the country’s most impor-tant companies, including its largest publishing house, which was also the power base of Icelandic culture as it controlled much of the coun-try’s literary heritage. Dressed in his trademark pin-striped suits he came to be Iceland’s greatest philanthropist, loved by the public, and was for a while perhaps more influential in the island’s cultural life than even the Minister of Culture, who in effect was downgraded to second fiddle in many opening ceremonies.  The Samson Group portrayed a much more sophisticated façade than the other business groups. To most Icelanders, Björgólfur Guðmundsson was  the  soft  face  of  the  Samson  Group,  which  controlled  Landsbanki.  His  son  Björgólfur  Thor  Björgólfsson  was,  however,  the  primus  motor  in  most  of  their  business  ventures.  Through  his  investment  company  Novator he controlled their foreign investments from his spacious office on  Park  Lane  in  London.  In  their  portfolio  were  phone  companies  in  Eastern  Europe,  international  drug  companies  and  businesses  around  the  world.  When  his  father  bought  Premier  League  football  club  West  Ham  United  in  East  London,  his  son  saw  it  as  a  well  deserved  trophy  investment,  though  perhaps  a  rather  pricey  toy  for  his  elderly  father  to enjoy in his senior years. In many of his international investments, Björgólfur Thor bypassed Landsbanki and instead used investment bank Straumur-Burðarás. Landsbanki had acquired Straumur investment fund from Íslandsbanki. Burðarás had held Eimskip’s extensive investments, which  the  shipping  company  had  accumulated  to  a  sizable  sum  over  the decades. Björgólfur Thor was able to merge the two and turned the result into an aggressive investment bank. In 2007, Björgólfur Thor was ranked in  Forbes  magazine among the richest people in the world, with ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":83,"content":"The Nordic Tiger – Imagined Economic Miracle 73an  estimated  net  worth  of  US$3.5  billion   2  .  The  sophisticated  face  of  Landsbanki was, however, misleading. After Árnason and his team were brought  in  from  Búnaðarbanki,  the  bank  became  almost  as  aggressive  as Kaupthing in its operations, first mostly domestically but soon also abroad.    Íslandsbanki/Glitnir  The  third  group  seeking  to  entrench  itself  within  the  emerging  accu-mulation regime revolved around Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson and his retail conglomerate  Baugur.  Jóhannesson  and  his  colleagues  had  manoeu-vred  themselves  into  the  FBA  against  the  will  of  the  government.  Their  control  was,  however,  diminished  when  the  investment  bank  merged  with  retail  bank  Íslandsbanki,  owned  by  Iceland’s  established  old  money,  the  so-called  network  of  wholesalers.  Jóhannesson  was  a  street-smart businessman of the roughest sort who viewed himself as an outsider in the Icelandic world of business. He had left high school to establish  Iceland’s  first  low-budget  supermarket,  Bónus,  together  with  his  father.  When  Hagkaup,  the  giant  retail  company  they  challenged  when entering the market, moved to acquire Bónus to get them out of the way, he quickly reversed the deal through leverage acquisition. This became the blueprint for his dealings around the world. With his wild long hair and dressed in tight black jeans he portrayed the persona of a rock star rather than a businessman or a refined banker.  Íslandsbanki  was  the  smallest  of  the  three  and  the  last  to  embark  on  the  voyage  abroad,  which  became  known  as  the  Icelandic  Viking  outvasion.  The  bank  was  managed  by  the  young  and  vibrant  Bjarni  Ármannsson, who had left Kaupthing to become CEO of the FBA. After the merger he had to use all his diplomatic skills to manoeuvre through its boardroom, where a fierce power struggle was raging. The old guard of  Iceland’s  cautious  wholesalers  was  under  siege  by  the  rough  crowd  around  Jón  Ásgeir  Jóhannesson.  Ármansson  identified  Norway  as  the  bank’s  main  market  for  growth  and  changed  its  name  to  Glitnir,  after  the ancient Norse god of law and justice.  After exhausting other domestic lending opportunities, having burst through his lending limits in Kaupthing and Landsbanki, Jóhannesson started buying into Glitnir. Foreign banks like Deutsche Bank, HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland had lent large sums of money to his group but Jóhannesson seemed to have an insatiable appetite for cash and thus set his sights on acquiring Glitnir. In 2007, the rough crowd finally gained control  over  the  bank  when  Jóhannesson’s  business  partner,  Hannes  Smárason, came into a third of the shares through his holding company ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":84,"content":"74   Iceland and the International Financial CrisisFL-Group, which later was renamed Stoðir. Amongst his main acquisitions was a controlling stake in AMR Corp, the parent company of American Airlines. Strapped to a golden parachute, Ármannsson was pushed out and a young subordinate from the London office, Lárus Welding, took control. After fast retuning the bank was instantly turned from being the most cautious of the three to perhaps the most aggressive.    Official expansion policy  The expansion of the banking sector was not entirely self-driven. It was also a result of government policies to broaden the base of the economy. In 2001, one of the main political advisors of the IP leadership, Professor Hannes  H.  Gissurarson,  published  a  book  entitled    How  Can  Iceland  Become  the  Richest  Country  in  the  World?   3    In  it  he  outlined  policies  of  privatization, capital liberalization and low taxation in accordance with tax havens like Jersey, Isle of Man, Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands. He argued that in combination with new banking secrecy laws, Iceland would through these measures be able to develop a competitive edge in the financial industry on a world scale (Gissurarson, 2001). In a piece in the  Wall Street Journal , headled  A Miracle on Iceland , Gissurarson (2004)  claimed  that  Mr  Oddsson’s  implementation  of  neoliberal  poli-cies  in  line  with  Milton  Friedman’s  and  Fredrik  Von  Hayek’s  thinking  had  led  Iceland  to  become  ‘one  of  the  world’s  most  prosperous  coun-tries’. In 2006, a government-appointed committee, analysing whether Iceland should become an international financial hub, reached similar conclusions  (Prime  Ministers  Office,  2006).  The  committee  was  led  by  Kaupthing’s Einarsson.     Leveraged expansion abroad  After economic restructuring, the three banks all headed for international markets through the newly opened gates of the European Economic Area. With fast growth and increased foreign equity their borrowing became easier  and  cheaper  as  interest  rates  fell  on  the  international  market.  Each  of  the  banks  bought  into  foreign  markets.  In  2000,  Landsbanki  acquired the small but long established Heritable Bank in London and Íslandsbanki-FBA  gained  control  over  two  tiny  banks  in  Copenhagen  and London. Kaupthing was, however, the most aggressive. While still an investment fund it opened offices in Luxembourg in 1998, followed by small brokerages in New York, Stockholm and Copenhagen. By 2004, Kaupthing  had  mustered  enough  clout  to  buy  Denmark’s  third-largest  bank, the conservative FIH Bank, which specialized in lending to small ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":85,"content":"The Nordic Tiger – Imagined Economic Miracle 75and  medium-size  firms.  The  acquisition,  which  more  than  doubled  Kaupthing’s balance sheet, was mainly financed by the largest offering to date on the Icelandic stock exchange, amounting to 4 per cent of the country’s GDP. To fund aggressive economic expansion, overseas invest-ment  capital  was  increasingly  mobilized  on  the  rapidly  growing  ICEX  stock market, which had become the popular symbol for the success of Iceland’s Viking Capitalism. A swath of the population was turning into venture capitalists. After acquiring the respectable Singer & Friedlander bank  in  London,  established  in  1907,  as  well  as  operations  in  the  Isle  of Man in the following year, Kaupthing was able to offer its customers wholesale funded services for large-scale investments.  This marked Iceland’s entry into the big league of European banking. The others followed suit, opening brokerages in Luxembourg and snatching up financial firms in Scandinavia and the UK. Glitnir, for example, acquired two regional banks in Norway: Kredidbanken and BN.  The  state  became  virtually  debt  free,  which  provided  the  Icelandic  banks with better ratings, perhaps on assumption that the state would back  them  up  if  they  entered  troubled  waters.  Bond  issuance  on  the  European market became a fruitful source of funding in the early years. After  winning  triple-A  ratings,  the  newly  privatized  Icelandic  banks  found  a  world  full  of  cheap  cash.  Established  German  banks  were  amongst  those  most  willing  to  lend  money  to  the  Icelandic  Viking  Capitalists, which in turn were, after decades of capital controls, eager to  get  their  hands  on  as  much  foreign  currency  as  they  could  grab.  Indeed, this was a perfect match. The Icelandic banks did not seem to be much bothered about the quality of their equity. Fuelled by foreign funding,  Icelandic  firms  were  thus  able  to  flock  en  masse  onto  inter-national  markets,  opening  subsidiaries  and  buying  up  foreign  firms  through leveraged acquisitions.  With easy access to foreign money and lowered equity constrains at home, the banks were enthusiastic to expand their lending. Interestingly, however,  during  the  years  of  massive  growth  in  the  banking  sector,  fierce  rivalry  developed  between  the  groups,  with  growing  animosity  and mutual accusations of wrongdoing. As a result, they seldom worked together  on  deals.  The  owners  of  the  banks  and  related  business  part-ners were, however, still able to exploit the situation and draw massive amounts  from  this  seemingly  endless  flow  of  cash.  In  all  of  the  three  banks the owners became the largest groups of borrowers, with almost unlimited  access  to  their  vaults.  Through  wide-ranging  investments  the  three  main  blocs  came  to  dominate  the  small  Icelandic  economy,  controlling, for example, insurance companies, oil companies and media ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":86,"content":"76   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisgroups. In only a few years, the owners in effect turned these universal commercial banks into their private investment funds.    Procyclical policies  As has been described here, Iceland experienced an incredible boom in the first years of the new millennium – which would, however, collapse dramatically in autumn 2008. It will be the task of scholars for decades to come to analyse what really happened and how these events could have  occurred  (see,  for  example,  Matthiasson,  2008).  In  addition  to  large-scale privatization, the sudden opening of European markets and cheap foreign loans there were other domestic policy factors that played a significant role. With the 1990 labour market Consensus Agreement, inflation,  which  had  devastated  Iceland’s  economy  for  decades,  had  finally been brought down. In 2001, a new monetary policy was intro-duced whereby the regime of a fixed exchange rate, which had proved extremely hard to maintain, was abandoned and the króna allowed to float  freely,  though  anchored  to  a  target  inflation  rate  of  2.5  per  cent  (with 1.5 per cent fluctuation margin), which the Central Bank was to keep to.  While   neo-corporatism   and   the   introduction   of   the   Individual   Tradable  Quota  (ITQ)  system  in  fisheries  had  dramatically  reshaped  societal paradigms in a market world direction, the social regulation of a  finance-dominated  regime  of  accumulation  required  further  efforts.  One particularly influential such effort was the continuous promotion and protection of home ownership. Iceland has a very strong tradition of home ownership, which is deeply embedded in the Icelandic culture of  independence.  In  the  wake  of  the  2003  election,  the  government  kept  an  election  promise  of  the  PP  and  further  increased  the  general  maximum  loan  of  the  public  Housing  Financing  Fund  from  around  65 per cent of market value to 90 per cent. The move significantly shrank the retail banks’ lucrative market in topping up the equity gap, which many  new  homebuyers  needed  to  bridge.  Subsequently,  the  banks  entered  the  housing  market  with  all  guns  blazing,  not  only  providing  full financing on housing but also offering better terms than the govern-ment housing fund. Parliament commissioned an investigative commis-sion to look into the Public Housing Fund, which concluded that it had been moved from a social vehicle into a market-orientated financial firm in aggressive competition with the banks, but still operating with public backing  (Flyering,  Heiðarsson  &  Stefánsson,  2013).  As  a  result,  house  prices  skyrocketed,  doubling  from  2004  to  2007  and  thus  forcing  up  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":87,"content":"The Nordic Tiger – Imagined Economic Miracle 77inflation once again. This added to the suffering of the general public as housing loans were indexed to the consumer price index, which in turn further strengthened commitment to monetarist policies.  Another contributing factor to the fantastical boom was the govern-ment-initiated  investment  in  numerous  public  power  plants.  This  was  in  accordance  with  a  long-standing  wish  to  utilize  the  country’s  geo-thermal  energy  in  order  to  both  expand  and  diversify  the  economy.  The largest of these was the aluminium smelter in Reyðarfjörður in the east of Iceland, which called for gigantic construction of river dams and massive industrial buildings. The PP drew most of its support from the countryside,  which  had  for  decades  been  gradually  depopulating  as  people  were  flocking  to  the  capital.  This  threatened  not  only  the  PP’s  existence  but  also  the  entire  Icelandic  project  as  our  identity  is  partly  based on the importance of populating the whole country and on the deeply rooted notion inherited from the independence struggle of the free and virtuous farmer. In an attempt to reverse the trend, the govern-ment teamed up with local municipalities and global aluminium compa-nies to finance the biggest investment project since the settlement – as luck would have it located in the old home constituency of the leader of  the  PP.  In  just  a  few  years,  Iceland’s  aluminium  production  tripled,  adding almost 5 per cent to economic growth.  While  the  PP  was  freely  allowed  to  inflate  the  economy  in  order  to  fulfil their extensive election promises, the IP leadership, the coalition’s senior partner, was busy pushing through the tax cut programme carved out  by  the  neoliberal  Locomotive  group.  Money  was  flowing  into  the  state’s  coffers  in  unprecedented  amounts.  In  2002,  corporate  tax  was  lowered  from  30  to  18  per  cent  and  in  2008  to  15  per  cent.  In  2003,  property tax was brought down from 1.2 to 0.6 per cent and it was abol-ished  altogether  in  2006.  In  2004,  the  rate  for  the  highest  income  tax  bracket  was  lowered  as  well  as  that  for  the  general  income  bracket.  In  each of 2005, 2006 and 2007, income tax was lowered by 1 per cent. In 2007, value added tax on selected items was brought from 17 per cent down to 7. Despite these extensive tax cuts, revenues were still on the rise, allowing the government to both increase public spending and pay all its foreign debts.  Already in 2004, Iceland ranked ninth on the world index of Economic Freedom. It had moved up from 53rd place in 1975. Neoliberal scholars like Arthur Laffer were referring to Iceland as a model tax regime (Laffer, Moore & Williams, 2007).  The government’s stated objective was to maintain economic stability and  reduce  economic  fluctuation,  thus  controlling  the  seemingly  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":88,"content":"78   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisendless boom and bust cycle. However, while the Central Bank was by law mandated to keep to the set inflation target, the government’s fiscal policy was pulling in the opposite direction, creating a constant tension between  the  two  main  areas  of  economic  policy.  Against  their  stated  aims, Icelandic governments from the mid-1990s ran an entirely procy-clical fiscal policy (Nielsson & Torfason, 2012).  Perhaps each of these policy projects of the government might have been achievable in separation but when they were executed simultane-ously the collective effect was to inflate the economy so drastically that it would eventually spin out of control. Prime Minister Davíð Oddsson dismissed most voices of caution. He claimed, for example, that econo-mists were as a class far too pessimistic; according to them, tax cuts were inadvisable  both  in  times  of  growth  and  in  times  of  decline  (quoted  in  Jónsson,  2000).  After  a  disagreement  with  the  National  Institute  of  Economic  Analysis  (Þjóðhagsstofnun),  he  abolished  the  institution  in  2002  and  moved  economic  analysis  to  the  Statistics  Bureau,  which  answered directly to the Prime Ministers Office.  Another  aspect  relates  to  Iceland’s  participation  in  the  European  Internal  Market,  which,  for  example,  required  Iceland  to  adopt  EU  regulations in the financial sector. EU directives stipulate a free flow of capital  within  a  common  framework,  which  members  are  to  honour.  Within  the  framework,  however,  each  Member  State  is  free  to  imple-ment  stricter  rules  in  accordance  with  local  conditions.  Iceland  never  laid down any such rules to limit its credit institutions. In fact it stuck to the bare minimum of such regulation.  On the contrary, the government was eager to advance the country’s competitiveness  abroad  without  violating  the  minimum  requirements  of the EEA agreement. To this end, financial firms’ liberty to invest in non-financial businesses, to extend credit to directors, to invest in real estate  companies,  to  lend  money  to  buy  own  shares  and  to  open  for  ownership in other credit institutions was increased. Similarly and with the  same  aim,  the  government  reduced  restrictions  on  the  operating  structure of securities companies.  To  counter  the  massive  credit  demand,  bringing  with  it  inflationary  pressure,  after  the  króna  had  been  floated  in  2001,  the  Central  Bank  had  no  option  but  to  increase  its  base  rate,  which  was  thus  kept  very  high  throughout  the  boom  years.  In  the  five  years  leading  up  to  The  Crash, the Central Bank frequently raised its interest rate, which rose in steps from 5.3 per cent to 15.5 per cent. Paradoxically, the government’s Housing Financing Fund was at the same time lowering interest rates in fierce competition with the banks. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":89,"content":"The Nordic Tiger – Imagined Economic Miracle 79 The  transition  capacity  of  setting  domestic  interest  rates  to  control  credit  demand  was,  however,  limited,  as  two-thirds  of  loans  were  at  a  fixed interest rate but indexed to the consumer price index where infla-tion would accumulate on top of the principal of the loan, which would thus be mostly pushed to the back end of it. Borrowers were thus more sensitive to long-term real interest rates than short-term nominal rates. Raising  nominal  interest  rates,  however,  served  to  inflate  the  value  of  the  króna  on  money  markets,  giving  our  small  currency  the  appear-ance  of  strength  and  providing  Icelandic  banks  with  easy  and  cheap  access to foreign capital. The impact of hiking interest rates was further undermined as many borrowers, amounting to one-sixth of the market, shunned the high-interest króna and instead took out loans in foreign currencies  with  nominal  interest  rates  set  to  the  international  level.  Turning  a  blind  eye  to  the  risk  most  new  corporate  loans  were  in  this  form. And the general public did not seem to comprehend the exchange rate risks of borrowing in foreign currency. These FX-linked loans were to hit us on the head when the currency tanked.  For  some  reason,  the  Central  Bank  did  nothing  to  make  wholesale  borrowing on the international market more costly. Indeed, nothing at all  was  done  to  control  the  ever-increasing  liquidity  flowing  over  the  riverbanks  of  Iceland’s  economy.  The  bank  never  even  considered,  for  example,  extending  holdings  in  foreign  assets  to  counter  the  demand  created by this relaxed fiscal policy. On the contrary and to the surprise of many, the bank even reduced reserve requirements in 2003. In addi-tion, as late as spring 2008, when the crisis was already raging, the bank abandoned  its  reserve  requirements  on  deposits  collected  in  foreign  branches of the Icelandic banks. As a result of these measures the entire system was short of foreign cash when the crisis hit.  Defining the hiking of interest rates as its only available tool against inflation, the Central Bank did little to limit the growth of the banking sector, which was expanding beyond the capacity of the state to control it.  The  Icelandic  Financial  Supervisory  Authority  (FME)  also  remained  weak and was never equipped with enough capacity to be able to catch up  with  the  growth  of  the  financial  system.  In  2006,  a  total  staff  of  only 45 was to supervise three banks, each of which was among the 300 largest banks in the world. Furthermore, the FME never even considered it their task to curb the unsustainable growth of the banks. This was in line  with  the  government’s  policy  of  supporting  the  internationaliza-tion  and  growth  of  the  banks  and  indeed  to  keep  them  domiciled  in  Iceland even though their size had outgrown the capacity of the Central Bank to back them up and the FME to control them. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":90,"content":"80   Iceland and the International Financial Crisis Another  side-effect  of  the  high  base  rate  was  that  it  attracted  hot  money  from  abroad.  The  interest  rate  offered  in  Iceland  was  gradu-ally  becoming  amongst  the  highest  attainable  in  the  world.  Demand  was  building  for  foreign  issue  bonds  in  Icelandic  króna  among  inves-tors who wanted to exploit the sizable interest rate differential. Among those issuing the so-called glacier bonds were the European Investment Bank  and  the  German  KFW.  They  would  use  Icelandic  banks  to  swap  their króna back to foreign currency. The Central Bank seemed to have no  control  over  the  inflow  of  money  brought  over  through  the  carry  trade  by  investors  who  borrowed  against  it  in  low-yielding  currencies  and  pocketing  the  difference,  these  also  included  ordinary  investors  such  as  ‘Belgian  dentists’  and  ‘Japanese  housewives’,  as  commentators  for  some  reason  often  referred  to  them  (Jóhannesson,  2009:  263).  In  fact,  the  Central  Bank  never  even  tried  to  control  the  liquidity  in  the  financial system.  Due to the small size of the economy the Icelandic exchange rate is all the more sensitive to capital movements. Still, many foreign inves-tors  did  not  seem  to  be  bothered  by  the  incredibly  high  value  of  this  tiny  nation’s  currency;  despite  the  fact  that  interest  rate  parity  clearly  indicated  it  was  due  to  depreciate  significantly.  In  the  lead-up  to  The  Crash, these glacier bonds amounted to almost 40 per cent of the coun-try’s  GDP.  These  are  closely  monitored,  high-risk  investments.  Traders  thus tend to abandon their stakes fast when the climate changes against their  interest.  Still,  The  Crash  took  many  by  surprise,  and  they  found  themselves  instantly  locked  within  the  Icelandic  króna  regime  behind  capital controls.    Spinning out of control  Iceland belonged to a group of states that experienced a net inflow of capital  in  the  first  years  of  the  new  millennium;  they  also  included  Estonia,  Germany,  Greece,  Ireland,  Italy,  Latvia,  Lithuania,  Portugal,  Spain  and  the  UK.  Many  of  these  were  amongst  the  most  severely  hit  countries in the coming crisis, that is the PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain). Iceland was in many respects, however, in a league of  its  own.  The  inflow  into  Iceland  was  greater  and  more  rapid  than  elsewhere. The banking sector grew much faster, labour market partici-pation was higher, unemployment was virtually non-existent and GDP per  capita  grew  well  beyond  other  capital  inflow  states  to  become  the  highest in Europe, second only to the US on the world index. By 2005, there  were  ever  more  visible  signs  of  serious  overheating.  Fuelled  by  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":91,"content":"The Nordic Tiger – Imagined Economic Miracle 81foreign  capital,  the  three  banks  grew  exponentially,  from  amounting  to  just  over  one  year’s  GDP  in  2000  to  almost  ten  times  the  country’s  annual GDP when the system collapsed. The most rapid growth was in the last few years. In 2005 alone, the three banks took out €15 billion worth  of  new  debt,  which  was  significantly  higher  than  the  country’s  GDP. In the same year, the banks reported a 40 per cent return on equity while  the  European  average  was  15  per  cent.  Between  2004  and  The  Crash  of  2008,  the  banks  had  been  able  to  issue  bonds  amounting  to  almost €50 billion, four times the GDP of the country (Benediktsdóttir, Danielsson  &  Zoega,  2011).  The  primitive  stock  market  also  expanded  massively, with many new listings. Breaking the world record, the stock market multiplied nine times over from the low of 2001 to the peak in 2007, when around 70 per cent of its value was in the financial sector (Halldórsson & Zoega, 2010).  Credit-driven consumption and investment led to a sustained current account  deficit,  averaging  just  below  15  per  cent  a  year  between  2003  and 2007. In this period, GDP grew by 6.4 per cent a year. Illustrative of the excess is that in 2007 more luxury Range Rovers were sold in Iceland than in Denmark and Sweden combined. The money supply increased by  up  to  half  a  year  and  housing  prices  doubled  in  only  a  few  years,  while  the  rise  in  real  wages  lagged  behind.  Iceland  was  clearly  living  well beyond its means. Credit expanded beyond most people’s imagina-tion.  Corporate  firms  and  ordinary  households  alike  tripled  their  real  exposure.  Foreign  liabilities  rose  from  75  per  cent  of  GDP  to  almost  500 per cent and domestic liabilities went from 60 per cent to around 270 per cent. Despite being unsustainable, the capital inflow was driving the whole economy with both asset prices and the currency rising way beyond  their  underlying  values,  promoting  both  imports  at  bargain  price and investment in the bloated economy. Still the government took no measures to increase savings. On the contrary, this seeming strength lured many into taking on mortgages and consumer debt, particularly car  loans,  denominated  in  foreign  currency,  to  finance  the  spending  bonanza of the 2000s.  The inflow of money also distorted the composition of the economy, for  example  expanding  the  construction  industry  well  beyond  the  capacity of the labour force. Increased demand led to a rapid inflow of foreign workers, growing to almost 10 per cent of the work force before The Crash of 2008. Most foreign workers came from Eastern Europe after these  had  entered  the  EU.  Many  brought  their  families  over.  In  just  a  few  years,  Iceland  went  from  being  a  highly  homogeneous  society  to  becoming  significantly  multicultural.  Many  Icelanders  welcomed  the  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":92,"content":"82   Iceland and the International Financial Crisischange  but  xenophobia  also  grew  in  public  discourse,  coming  to  the  surface of Icelandic politics when the so-called Liberal Party (which in fact was anything but liberal in its policies) campaigned actively against immigration  and  multiculturalism  while  nourishing  the  nationalist  sentiment always underlying Icelandic political discourse.  Iceland is a small country with limited human resources. The finan-cial sector was thus sucking talent from other branches of the economy, which as a result suffered a constant brain drain, depriving many crea-tive  industry  innovations  of  the  oxygen  they  needed  to  take  off.  Not  many could compete with the banks, which were offering new recruits fresh out of college higher salaries than their parents could even have dreamed of. The banks were indeed sponsoring the financialization of the entire society.    Mother of all shopping sprees  Iceland  was  not  only  a  recipient  of  money.  Our  Viking  Capitalists  exploited  the  situation  and  utilized  the  newly  privatized  banks  to  embark on one of the greatest shopping sprees in world history, buying up businesses and investing their borrowed cash around the world. The simultaneous leveraged  outvasion  of Icelandic companies was also caused by fierce internal competition between the groups of Viking Capitalists. Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson bought up many of the main retail companies in London and Copenhagen, including House of Fraser, Hamley’s, Karen Miller and Iceland frozen food stores, to name just a few. Within his port-folio  were  companies  running  more  than  3,800  stores  and  employing  65,000  people.  For  a  while,  the  company  owned  a  large  proportion  of  the UK’s high street stores.  Icelandic investors acquired airlines on both side of the Atlantic and held stakes in the travel industry around the world. The Kaupthing clan was  focusing  on  financial  firms  and  insurance  companies  throughout  Scandinavia. Björgólfur Thor became a real live business tycoon in the newly  liberal  Eastern  Europe,  acquiring  many  newly  privatized  firms,  such as phone and drug companies, while his father rubbed shoulders with international high society in his private chairman’s lounge at West Ham stadium in East London.  All  the  groups  established  real  estate  holding  companies,  acquiring  many landmark buildings in neighbouring capitals. Often, they would compete  against  each  other  for  the  same  assets  and,  because  of  their  constant rivalry and mutual animosity, on occasion entered into fiercely fought  bidding  wars.  Many  of  the  main  acquisitions  in  2006,  2007  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":93,"content":"The Nordic Tiger – Imagined Economic Miracle 83and  2008  were  far  greater  than  most  Icelanders  could  comprehend.  Even these paled into insignificance when compared with some of the planned  endeavours,  which  were  halted  only  by  The  Crash.  Amongst  them were Askar Capital’s plans to build a high-rise neighbourhood in Macau and even a complete high-tech town in India.  Being children of the Icelandic postcolonial national identity, discussed in  Chapter  1,  many  Viking  Capitalists  were  focused  on  Copenhagen,  Iceland’s old colonial capital. London was always the main hub of their ventures  but  acquisitions  in  Copenhagen  were  hailed  in  the  Icelandic  media  –  and  by  the  Viking  Capitalists  themselves  –  as  the  greatest  conquests. Before the boom, Icelandic business ventures in Copenhagen were mostly limited to a few pizza parlours, inner neighbourhood cafes and  side-street  bars.  In  only  a  few  years,  Icelandic  businessmen  had  acquired  the  two  largest  and  most  majestic  Danish  downtown  depart-ment stores (Magasin Du Nord and Illum), the country’s second-largest airline (Sterling) and its most prestigious hotel (D’Angleterre), and their real estate companies not only held large shares of the main shopping streets but also many key government buildings. Many of these can be considered  trophy  investments  rather  than  coldly  calculated  business  deals, each acquisition perhaps a statement by the former poor colony that it had now grown up and should be taken seriously on the world stage.  In  addition,  Icelanders  established  their  own  Danish  newspaper  ( Nyhedsavisen ), which became one of the most widely distributed in the country.  They  also  ran  their  own  chains  of  fashion  boutiques,  restau-rants  and  delegate  food  stores.  Icelanders  living  in  Copenhagen  were  for a while able to spend their money almost solely with Icelandic-held companies, which would fulfil most of their daily needs.  Before  the  boom,  Iceland  had  for  centuries  been  an  egalitarian  society  with  no  super-rich  people.  The  income  of  the  old  wholesaler  class  was  perhaps  a  few  times  higher  than  that  of  their  employees  on  the  shop  floor.  In  the  new  millennium,  however,  high  salaries  in  the  banking sector were causing the upper class to lose touch with ordinary Icelanders.  Prices  in  Reykjavik  were  rising  beyond  the  means  of  many  locals  as  the  nouveau-riche  behaviour  of  the  Viking  Capitalists  ripped  apart the fabric of society. On Friday afternoons, Reykjavik airport would be filled with the private jets of the Viking Capitalists returning home just in time for their bookings at the trendy new Reykjavik restaurants.

For his annual parties for Icelanders in London, Ármann  Þorvaldsson,  the  CEO  of  Kaupthing  Singer  and  Friedlander,  hired famous bands like Duran Duran. Once, he introduced Tom Jones on  stage  and  sang  with  him  the  legend’s  hit  song    Delilah .  Reports  of  racing  Ferraris  in  Monte  Carlo,  partying  with  high  society  on  private  yachts in Florida and in the Mediterranean and even eating gold risotto at  business  dinners  filled  the  news.  The  Icelandic  businessmen  were,  however,  enjoying  the  limelight  and  the  ego-nourishing  attention  of  the international media, which hailed them as a new breed of business geniuses. The business sections of the world’s most prestigious newspa-pers celebrated their fast decision making as a fresh and admirable style of  doing  business.  Jón  Ásgeir  Jóhannesson,  for  example,  stemmed  the  overflow of tedious information and became famous for his ‘one-page’ management style and distaste for bureaucracy.  Foreign  acquisitions  were  the  buzzword  of  the  day  and  this  new  style of business was affecting the whole society. Even small-time busi-nessmen,  owners  of  dry-cleaning  shops  and  car  service  centres,  would  leverage themselves to open up subsidiaries abroad just to be part of the game. Those left behind and operating only in Iceland were thought to have been relegated to a second league.    Nourishing the superiority complex  The  seemingly  reckless  behaviour  of  the  Viking  Capitalists  cannot  be  solely  attributed  to  their  own  individual  characteristics.  To  galva-nize  the  coherence  and  credibility  of  this  emerging  Viking  Capitalist  historic  bloc,  the  Icelandic  authorities  in  effect  blessed  their  opera-tions.  In  this  respect  the  political,  intellectual  and  moral  leadership  of  President  Ólafur  Ragnar  Grímsson  cannot  be  overestimated.  His  speeches  around  the  world  at  the  time  of  the  millennium,  steeped  as  they were in the nationalist discourse, gave valuable credibility to the Viking  faction  of  capital  both  in  Iceland  and  internationally.  Already  at the turn of the millennium, he was predicting ‘that the features of the new global economy are such as to allow us Icelanders to prosper as never before and give our global partners access to a highly rewarding co-operation’  (Grímsson,  2000).  He  explained  that  creativity  was  the  backbone  of  the  Icelandic  heritage,  ‘creativity  which  centuries  ago  produced  the  Icelandic  sagas  and  the  Edda  Poems,  unique  literary  achievements in medieval Europe [ ... ] is clearly what confers a competi-tive edge in the modern global economy and will do so even more in the knowledge-based industries and services of the 21st century’ (ibid.). ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":95,"content":"The Nordic Tiger – Imagined Economic Miracle 85 Kristín Loftsdóttir (2011) points out that Icelanders have long empha-sized  the  purity  of  their  ethnic  origin,  ‘combined  with  grand  narra-tives of how they gained independence and became one of the richest nations  in  the  world.’  Tapping  directly  into  the  national  myth,  the  President  didn’t  hesitate  to  explain  Iceland’s  postcolonial  success  in  terms of the unique origin of the nation, thus linking the present with the past. He went on to explain how Icelandic creativity manifests itself not  only  in  literature  and  the  arts  but  also  in  the  running  of  modern  companies. ‘Thousands of companies all over the country demonstrate the  fascinating  combination  of  entrepreneurship  and  creativity  which  is  so  uniquely  Icelandic’  (Grímsson,  2000).  He  proclaimed  that  in  the  new global economy, Icelanders’ spirit of exploration and the Icelandic heritage  of  creativity  gave  the  nation  unique  opportunities  to  prosper  as never before. Thanks to this, Iceland was becoming ‘one of the most interesting modern societies on earth, a society that is using technology to achieve one of the highest living standards in the world’ (ibid.). He concluded his millennium speech in Los Angeles by saying that it was in ‘this spirit that we have come to Los Angeles to share with you [the people of America] the excitement of our future’ (ibid.).  With the growing success of Viking Capitalism, the President’s nation-alistic rhetoric amplified. In a speech at the Walbrook Club in London a few years later, he started off by linking the success of the Icelandic busi-nessmen to the Cod Wars between Iceland and the UK and reminded his audience that Iceland was the ‘only nation on earth to defeat the British Navy, not once but three times’ (Grímsson, 2005). He said that with this unique track record in mind, ‘it is no wonder that young entrepreneurial Vikings  have  arrived  in  London  full  of  confidence  and  ready  to  take  on  the  world!’  (ibid.).  When  explaining  Iceland’s  success  he  enthused  in  typical  nationalist  discourse  that  Icelandic  ‘business  culture,  our  approach, our way of thinking and our behaviour patterns, rooted in our traditions  and  national  identity’,  had  through  ‘unique  qualities  given  [our]  businesses  a  competitive  edge,  enabling  us  to  win  where  others  either failed or did not dare to enter. Our entrepreneurs have thus been able to move faster and more effectively, to be more original and more flexible, more reliable but also more daring than many others’ (ibid.).  Though the President perhaps went further than most, his narratives were widely echoed during the boom years. Tapping into the national myth deriving from the independence struggle, a report on the image of Iceland commissioned by the Prime Minister’s office in 2008 attributed this perceived success to ‘unique characteristics’ of the Icelandic nation ‘which separate Icelanders from other nations’ (Prime Ministers Office, ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":96,"content":"86   Iceland and the International Financial Crisis2008).  This  uniqueness  of  the  Icelandic  nation  was  said  to  stem  from  the  fact  that  the  people  lived  in  harmony  with  harsh  nature,  which  had  created  a  special  natural  force  within  the  Icelandic  nation.  The  report concluded that on this basis the core of Iceland’s image should be ‘power, freedom and peace’ (ibid.). Here the internationalization of Iceland’s  economy  is  indeed  interpreted  through  a  romantic  nation-alist discourse. A report on the future of Iceland commissioned by the Icelandic  Chamber  of  Commerce  in  2006  echoed  the  writings  of  Jón  Jónsson Aðils a century earlier in placing Iceland at the peak of civiliza-tion when it suggested that Iceland should ‘no longer compare itself with the other Nordic states, as we overreach them in most fields’ (Icelandic Chamber  of  Commerce,  2006).  In  2007,  the  annual  conference  of  the  Icelandic  Chamber  of  Commerce  was  held  under  the  slogan  ‘Iceland,  best  in  the  world?’  (Ísland,  best  í  heimi?,  2007).  In  the  University  of  Iceland’s  Business  Department,  an  exceptionally  well  funded  research  project named  INTICE –   Outvasion of Icelandic Companies  was launched the following year, analysing the superiority of the Icelandic  outvasion  model  (Ólafsson,  2008).  Its  success  was  mostly  attributed  to  informal  channels of communication, boldness and quick decision making. The project, which was financed by many of the main  outvasion  companies, instantly ran out of funding after The Crash.  This thinking was also noticeable in the more benign cultural  outva-sion ,  as  illustrated  by  Georg  Holm,  bassist  of  the  band  Sigur  Ros,  in  March  2008  when  explaining  that  Icelanders  were  ‘intensely  proud  of  our mighty homeland’ – adding that it was ‘in our Viking blood to want to conquer nations and peoples’ (quoted in Hooper, 2008).  Out  of  this  nationalistic  discourse  emerges  a  theory  of  a  unique  nation  which  had  over  the  centuries  developed  special  characteristics,  but had until recently been limited by its smallness and isolation. The theory explains how this uniquely talented nation would now through increased globalization almost inevitably lead Icelanders to great success on  the  world  stage.  This  discourse  of  the  uniqueness  of  the  Icelandic  nation  heard  in  the  boom  years  draws  on  the  national  myth,  which  has  remained  central  to  Icelandic  societal  paradigms  from  its  creation  during  the  independence  struggle  in  the  19th  century.  The  President  directly  linked  the  contemporary  Viking  Capitalists  with  the  original  Viking settlers of the 9th century, claiming that they displayed the same qualities  and  indeed  the  same  spirit.  This  is  what  Anthony  D.  Smith  (1993)  refers  to  as  ‘the  myth  of  a  common  ancestry’.  This  discourse  is  also evidence of the Viking image being used to refer to a time of polit-ical autonomy, as, for example, Nielsen Germaud (2010) explains.  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":97,"content":"The Nordic Tiger – Imagined Economic Miracle 87  Conclusion  Iceland’s economy has been characterized by continuous cycles of boom and  bust.  In  the  first  decade  of  the  new  millennium,  Icelanders  were,  however, taken on a greater economic roller-coaster ride than perhaps any other people in this crisis. After the country had entered the Single European Market, the newly privatized banks flocked abroad en masse in  what  became  known  as  Iceland’s    outvasion .  Inexperienced  as  they  surely were, access to cheap foreign funding allowed the Icelandic Viking Capitalists  to  embark  on  one  of  the  world’s  greatest  shopping  sprees,  snatching up foreign companies in neighbouring capitals through lever-aged acquisitions.  Procyclical  economic  policies  did  nothing  to  contain  the  boom.  On  the  contrary:  in  conjunction  with  widespread  neoliberal  domestic  deregulation,  massive  new  industrial  construction,  increasing  public  housing loans and far-reaching tax cuts were pumping hot air into an already overinflating bubble. The Central Bank’s only response – hiking interest  rates  rather  than  tightening  its  control  with  broader  means  –  was counterproductive, as it led to hot money pouring even faster into the country over the carry trade. The aspiration to meet inflation targets is thus risky when high interest rates attract capital inflow.  For  a  while,  the  new  breed  of  Viking  Capitalists  were  hailed  by  the  international media as business geniuses. Their nouveau-riche lifestyles were, however, ripping apart the fabric of this tiny, egalitarian society. With the consumer price index shooting through the roof and housing prices  skyrocketing,  the  general  public  was  left  behind,  resulting  in  massive  household  borrowing.  In  order  to  keep  up  appearances,  ordi-nary people turned themselves into venture capitalists.  Many  economists  warned  that  these  policies,  which  would  lead  to  a  prolonged  period  of  major  trade  deficit,  would  eventually  result  in  a steep reversal, if not a full-blown depression. However, any words of caution were dismissed, as they countered the age-old desire for modern-ization and diversification carved out in the independence struggle and developing into the postcolonial national identity. Nothing was to stop Iceland’s long-awaited Golden Age.

The  response  was  one  of  defiance,  fuelled  by  nationalist  rhetoric.  Instead  of  contemplating  the  criticism,  our  government  responded  by  launching  PR  campaigns  abroad. Any criticism of the new Icelandic financial system was viewed as  threat  to  the  entire  Icelandic  project,  to  the  positioning  of  modern  Iceland  as  an  equal  partner  within  the  ranks  of  prosperous  Western  states.  When  liquidity  dried  up  on  foreign  markets,  the  oversized  and  ever thirsty Icelandic banks responded by opening internet-based banks abroad,  offering  high  interest  on  deposits.  Foreign  cash  floated  in  through the web and for a while helped to lubricate the failing engine of the monstrosity our Viking Capitalists had created. After a near-death experience, the mini-crisis was believed to be over by late 2006.  With  a  renewed  certificate  of  good  health  the  Viking  Capitalists  ripped loose of all chains and blew even more hot air into the economy. After clear signs of overheating in the preceding years, Iceland’s finance-driven  economy  was  allowed  to  grow  even  faster  in  2006  and  2007.  Having grown from roughly the size of its GDP at the beginning of the decade to five times that in 2005, the banks doubled in size again in the coming couple of years, still without attracting much criticism.  Negative reporting on Iceland, however, appeared again in early 2008. We later learned that by then the economy was no longer sustainable. With increasingly limited access to funding, Iceland was being pushed out  of  international  financial  markets.  The  downfall  leading  up  to  the  devastating  crash  in  October  2008  started  in  January  and  finally  reached the point of no return when, in an extraordinary move, Glitnir was nationalized in late September. This chapter discusses the dramatic       5   Living on the Edge – Hot Air Flaring Up the Economy   ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":99,"content":"Hot Air – Living on the Edge 89events  after  the  mini-crisis  of  early  2006,  leading  up  to  the  banking  collapse  of  October  2008.  In  this  period,  Icelanders  were  in  economic  terms living on the edge – before finally falling off the financial cliff.    The 2006 Geyser crisis  The  clouds  gathering  on  the  horizon  first  became  visible  to  ordinary  eyes  in  early  2006  with  a  row  of  international  reports  portraying  a  negative  outlook  for  the  until  then  booming  economy.  Its  incredible  growth  and  the  far-reaching  ‘outvasion’  of  Icelandic  businessmen  had  attracted attention around the world. The perceived wealth of ordinary households  had  grown  three  times  in  as  many  years.  Few,  however,  questioned  how  this  tiny  nation  could  generate  so  many  high-flying  international  businessmen  in  such  a  short  period.  Initially,  the  new  Vikings  had  mostly  been  glorified  in  the  international  media  but  by  2005  more  critical  voices  started  to  filter  through  all  the  praise.  The  Danish  media  turned  particularly  hostile,  telling,  for  example,  mostly  unfounded tales of Russian mafia money running through Iceland’s lava and spreading from the rocky island out to the continent. The tone in many comments – and the way in which the case was framed – pointed to disbelief amongst many in the old colonial master country that poor old Iceland could emerge as a serious player in the global economy.  Analysts and many hedge fund managers were at the same time increas-ingly  noticing  signs  of  a  bubble  building  after  extensive  overheating.  With growth of 20 per cent over three years, virtually no unemployment and a central bank policy rate at 14 per cent, there seemed little room for further growth. The annual current account deficit reaching 20 per cent  did  not  seem  very  convincing,  either.  In  a  report  on  Kaupthing  in  November  2005  the  Royal  Bank  of  Scotland  (2005)  voiced  inves-tors’ concern about the health of Icelandic banks. With a balance sheet two-and-a-half times larger than the country’s GDP, Kaupthing alone was growing beyond the capacity of the Central Bank to back it up in time of crisis. The same was becoming true of both Glitnir and Landsbanki. Furthermore,  the  clearly  overvalued  Icelandic  króna  (ISK)  was  shining  like an easy target. It might be easy to take down and pocket the spoils.  Like  wolves,  hedge  funds  hunt  in  packs.  In  late  2005,  a  cluster  of  them  had  started  shorting  the  króna.  Taking  out  credit  default  swaps  (CDSs) on stocks of the Icelandic banks, they were betting not only on a sharp devaluation of the króna but also on financial firms collapsing as a result. CDSs are credit derivatives contracts in which the buyer insures ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":100,"content":"90   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisa financial asset. Shorting banks with CDSs can be very lucrative if the price  of  the  asset  falls  before  payments  are  due.  Branded  a  ‘financial  weapon  of  mass  destruction’  by  investor  Warren  Buffet  (2003),  CDSs  can be lethal. They are perhaps comparable to others taking out insur-ance on your house. The increasing spread of such insurance by stran-gers increases the likelihood of your house being burned to the ground. Similarly,  an  increased  CDS  spread  on  banks  raises  a  red  flag  on  the  market.  The  source  of  the  CDS  spread  on  the  Icelandic  banks  has  been  traced to a single fund manager at the Norwegian Petrol Fund, which is  reported  to  have  been  the  first  to  buy  such  protection  (Jónsson,  2009).  Others  followed  suit.  The  force  of  numbers  increases  pressure  and  thus  the  likelihood  of  a  successful  takedown.  Reportedly,  a  wide-spread attack on Iceland was plotted in an informal club of hedge funds named Drobny Global Advisors. In early February 2006, a message was circulated among this group of around fifty hedge funds suggesting that they  should  go  short  on  the  Icelandic  króna  and  other  high-yielding  currencies (ibid.).  On 21 February, Fitch Ratings (2006) changed its outlook on Icelandic banks  from  ‘stable’  to  ‘negative’,  mostly  because  of  massive  foreign  private  sector  borrowing  and  slack  domestic  fiscal  policy.  The  report  came  as  a  shock  to  most  Icelanders,  who  until  then  had  remained  oblivious to any economic difficulty. Nervously, the carry traders started constantly monitoring their charts, ready to leave at a moment’s notice. As a result, the króna fell by 7.5 per cent, the banks’ liability in foreign currency rose and the stock market took a significant hit in this initial shock. Increased business defaults followed.  Two  weeks  later,  Merrill  Lynch  raised  concerns  over  the  Icelandic  banks’   interconnectedness   (and   the   consequent   risk   of   systemic   collapse),  their  private  equity  profiles  and  their  reliance  on  wholesale  borrowing  abroad  (Thomas,  2006).  Iceland  was  being  hit  right,  left  and  centre.  The  major  blows  seemed  to  come  at  two-week  intervals.  The next one was served by the Danish commercial bank, Den Danske Bank,  in  its  very  first  report  on  Iceland,  called  Geyser  Crisis,  dated  21 March 2006 (Valgreen & Christensen, 2006). The bank claimed that the Icelandic financial system was about to implode and concluded that Iceland  had  already  been  frozen  out  of  international  capital  markets.  This time, it was not only the research division that was reporting on the issue but also the operational part of the Danske Bank that was taking action. Before publishing the report, the bank had ceased all trading in króna and closed lines to the Icelandic banks, even to our Central Bank. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":101,"content":"Hot Air – Living on the Edge 91Subsequently,  some  of  the  Danish  media  even  began  warning  Danes  against working for Icelandic-held companies in their country.  By  the  end  of  March  2006,  the  cracks  in  the  Icelandic  financial  system were becoming plainly evident. A group of investors on a trip to  Reykjavik,  organized  by  Barclays  Bank,  launched  into  a  shouting  match  with  their  hosts  at  Kaupthing’s  headquarters.  Many  of  the  participants had already shorted the króna and taken out CDSs on the banks. During the bank’s defensive presentation one guest is reported to have intervened and shouted: ‘This is not a bank, but a hedge fund’ (Jónsson, 2009).  Icelandic bankers and politicians alike felt the walls closing in. Disaster stories of the country’s predicted downfall spread through the interna-tional  media,  with  headlines  like:  ‘Iceland  melting’,  ‘Icelandic  erup-tion’, ‘Deep freeze’ and ‘Geyser crisis’. Concerned investors and analysts were flocking to the country to investigate the health of the economy. Consequently, the CDS spread widened even further and the Icelandic banks  found  themselves  being  pushed  out  of  international  wholesale  financial  markets.  In  only  two  months,  February  and  March,  the  ISK  fell  by  20  per  cent.  Globally,  the  pressure  had  been  building  on  high-yielding  currencies  such  as  the  New  Zealand  dollar,  the  South  African  rand and the Turkish lira. When critical reports on Iceland’s economy emerged  in  the  international  media,  these  other  high-yielding  curren-cies fell with the króna.  The 2006 Geyser Crisis took most Icelanders by surprise. We had all been living in a financial fairytale, told through thick nationalistic discourse. The domestic response to criticism of the sustainability of the Icelandic ‘economic  miracle’  was  one  of  defiance,  perhaps  due  to  a  galvanized  spirit  of  Viking  Capitalism.  The  Icelandic  government  and  most  other  actors in the society dismissed the warnings as ill-intentioned carping by envious foreigners. Nevertheless, the Icelandic government launched a series of defensive PR campaigns in London, New York and Copenhagen. The Minister of Commerce, Valgerður Sverrisdóttir (PP), said that envy was the root of the criticism by Fitch Ratings and dismissed the concerns of the Danish commercial bank by suggesting that Denmark’s self-image had  been  damaged  by  Iceland’s  success  (Sverrisdóttir,  2006).  Similarly,  the Minister of Education, Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir (IP), suggested to the Merrill Lynch researchers that they should re-educate themselves, as they clearly did not understand the particular nature of the Icelandic economy (Gunnarsdóttir, 2008).  Volatility  was  to  characterize  our  economy  in  the  coming  months,  with repeated rescue missions to save the króna from free fall. The most ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":102,"content":"92   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisserious  attack  came  on  21  April,  when  in  a  single  day  trading  on  the  króna amounted to more than 7 per cent the country’s GDP. In the whole of the month of April, trading on the króna amounted to more than half of GDP. Finally, the attackers were beaten back with heavy losses. This, however,  almost  exhausted  the  Central  Bank’s  capacity  to  defend  the  króna.  The  IMF  voiced  its  concerns  over  a  systemic  collapse  in  a  staff  report dated August 2006 (International Monetary Fund, 2006).  Domestic  actors  immediately  organized  a  multi-faced  defence.  One  aspect   was   to   commission   world-renowned   scholars   like   Frederic   Mishkin (Mishkin & Herbertsson, 2006) of Colombia and Richard Portes (Portes  &  Baldursson,  2007)  of  the  London  Business  School  to  write  reports, together with Icelandic academics, which were used to provide Iceland’s  economy  with  a  renewed  certificate  of  good  health.  On  the  basis  of  a  firm  regulatory  framework  and  strong  institutional  back-up,  both  reports  concluded  that  no  real  worries  were  warranted  regarding  Iceland’s financial system.  With a credit reserve of only €1 billion to fend off the attacks there was hardly a euro left in the Central Bank’s vaults when it finally ended. Its  narrow  escape  from  this  near-death  experience,  however,  only  re-boosted the self-confidence of the Icelandic bankers, who responded by  blowing  even  more  hot  air  into  the  already  over-inflated  bubble,  resulting  in  greater  growth  in  2007  than  ever  before.  The  mini-crisis  had not reduced Icelanders’ appetite for growth. By mid-2006, Iceland had been able to rebuff the attacks. Illustrative of that was Landsbanki’s $2.25 million bond issue in August 2006, brokered between the Bank of  America,  Citi  Group  and  Deutsche  Bank,  which  perhaps  marked  the  formal  end  of  the  mini-crisis.  Some  have  since  claimed  that  the  way  Icelanders  were  able  to  rebuff  the  crisis  created  a  sort  of  miracle  complex amongst them, a deeply rooted conviction of not being able to fail (Jóhannesson, 2009: 202).    New funding model  Barely surviving the 2006 Geyser Crisis, the banks were, however, not yet out of the wood. Their business model relied on being able to raise funds in the short-term financial market. With restricted access to wholesale funding on international markets, the banks were in desperate need of finding alternative funding to pay their asset purchases. To levitate their exposure  to  wholesale  funding,  both  Landsbanki  and  Kaupthing  initi-ated novel, high-interest internet-based retail deposit schemes – which would later be the source of Iceland’s greatest international legal dispute ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":103,"content":"Hot Air – Living on the Edge 93to date. As a participant in the EU Single Market, Iceland was inside the European passport system so the banks were able to operate almost like domestic entities throughout the continent.  Landsbanki bypassed its Heritable subsidiary in London and instead, in October 2006, opened a UK branch named Icesave. No one seemed to even contemplate the risk involved. Without any objections from either Icelandic  or  UK  authorities,  the  bank  quoted  the  EU/EEA  directive  on  Depositors Guarantee Schemes, they claimed to be in place in Iceland, which,  they  said,  would  protect  all  deposits  up  to  €20,887.  This  was  however always very ambiguous.  The  difference  between  a  branch  and  a  subsidiary  is  here  signifi-cant  because  branches  were  under  surveillance  in  the  home  country  of the parent bank, while subsidiaries were subject to such monitoring in  the  host  country.  An  even  more  significant  difference  was  that  the  branch  system  allows  the  bank  to  move  deposits  across  borders.  Kaupthing  opened  a  similar  high-yielding  internet  deposits  scheme,  named  Kaupthing  Edge.  However,  unlike  Landsbanki  with  Icesave,  Kaupthing used its subsidiary, Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander, to host the deposits. Edge deposits therefore had to be kept in the UK and were under British banking regime surveillance. At the time, few noticed the difference, which after The Crash left those involved in the two cases a world apart.  Playing on an Icelandic symbol, Icesave was marketed to tap into the trust associated with Nordic economies. Soon attracting the favourable attention of the financial media, the scheme became an instant success. The  Sunday Times , for example, wrote enthusiastically about the scheme under  the  headline:  ‘Icesave  looks  like  a  hot  deal’  (Hussain,  2006).  Before  the  end,  Icesave  had  attracted  almost  as  many  savers  as  there  were inhabitants in Iceland. In addition many charities, public institu-tions  and  municipalities  were  rushing  their  money  through  the  wires  as  the  internet-based  bank  was  offering  higher  interest  rates  than  its  competitors. Among them were Cambridge and Oxford Universities, the Metropolitan Police and even the UK Audit Commission. Through the scheme, Landsbanki collected more money than Iceland’s entire GDP.  In early 2006, Landsbanki had barely escaped collapsing. By the end of  the  year,  however,  it  was  being  inundated  with  money.  The  staff  monitoring  the  site  could  barely  believe  their  eyes  when  watching  the  foreign  currency  accumulating  on  their  computer  screens.  When  foreign deposits seemingly had saved Landsbanki from default in 2006, its  CEO,  Mr  Árnason,  declared  the  high-interest  deposit  scheme  ‘pure  genius’  1   (Árnason, 2007). In spring 2008, just months before The Crash, ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":104,"content":"94   Iceland and the International Financial CrisisLandsbanki opened a similar Icesave branch in the Netherlands and was planning  many  such  sites  in  11  other  countries,  mainly  EU  Member  States. Later, the celebrated scheme turned into a long-drawn-out night-mare  for  all  involved.  The  Icesave  dispute  was  not  only  about  to  turn  friendly  nations  into  Iceland’s  enemies  but  was  also  to  rip  apart  our  close-knit society in fierce infighting for years to come.    Love letters and self-inflation  In  addition  to  attracting  foreign  deposits  over  the  internet,  the  banks  took  many  measures  to  broaden  their  funding  base  –  many  of  which,  in hindsight, were highly dubious. To boost stock prices and keep them afloat,  the  banks,  for  example,  adopted  the  practice  of  accepting  their  own  shares  as  collateral  against  loans  to  employees  and  related  actors  for  investing  in  the  bank.  The  government  facilitated  this  measure  when  increasing  its  authorization  to  lend  money  to  buy  own  shares.  This  inflated  share  prices  but  also  created  weak  accounted  equity.  Surprisingly, the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority FME did not act  to  prevent  this  capital  manipulation.  Right  up  until  the  end,  the  banks employees were ever more heavily pressured to participate in this equity self-inflating exercise.  The  so-called  ‘love  letter’  triangle  similarly  served  to  inflate  equity.  In  order  to  access  more  liquidity,  the  big  banks  sold  securities  to  smaller banks, which used the bonds as collateral against Central Bank borrowing. The money from the Central Bank was then furthered back as  payment  to  the  initial  bank.  After  fine-tuning  the  scheme  domesti-cally,  the  big  three  played  a  similar  trick  on  both  the  Central  Bank  of  Luxembourg  and  the  European  Central  Bank  via  their  subsidiaries  in  Luxembourg.  By  the  end,  Iceland  had  extracted  €4.5  billion  from  the  euro system, a third of it collateral in bonds in the Icelandic banks.  This played on a practice also used to boost the equity price of some of the Icelandic holding companies to make room for more borrowing. Company  A  would  sell  an  asset  to  company  B,  which  would  return  it  well  above  the  asset  value.  This  created  room  for  more  borrowing  against  fake  collateral.  The  Sterling  airline  in  Denmark,  for  example,  was  sold  many  times  between  the  different  Icelandic  companies  with  an  ever-higher  price  tag,  which  would  then  be  leveraged  to  the  top.  Companies would also swap assets well above their value, to the same end.  It  worked  like  this:  I  sell  you  my  goat  for  a  million  euros  and  you sell me your sheep for the same price. We both leverage our newly acquired assets to the top in accordance with the new asset price. Now ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":105,"content":"Hot Air – Living on the Edge 95we are no longer farmers, but a hedge fund. For some reason the FME never  tried  to  prevent  this  capital  manipulation,  which  led  to  very  weak  equity.  By  the  end,  25  per  cent  of  the  banks’  total  capital  was  without  other  assets  to  back  it  up.  The  report  of  Parliament’s  Special  Investigation  Commission  (SIC)  states  that  weak  capital  amounted  to  up  to  half  of  the  banks’  core  capital.  The  banks  also  practised  cross-financing, where one would fund an investor to buy shares in another and vice versa. If cross-financing is factored in, weak capital amounted to 70 per cent of the total (Hreinsson et al., 2010).  However dubious these measures might seem with the benefit of hind-sight, they worked beautifully at the time. Even after the steep growth between 2003 and 2005, the economy grew a further 10 per cent in the two years following the early 2006 mini-crisis. With help from foreign workers who flocked to the country at a rate of a thousand a month, a hard landing was avoided in 2006 and 2007. Interestingly, even though Iceland  was  criticized  after  the  Geyser  Crisis  for  having  allowed  the  financial system to grow from roughly the size of its GDP to five times that in 2005, the banks doubled in size again in the coming couple of years, still without attracting much criticism.  By  2007,  the  three  Icelandic  banks  had  all  reached  the  list  of  the  300 largest banks in the world. This was the most rapid expansion of a banking system the world had ever seen. Qualifying them as too impor-tant to the Icelandic economy to be allowed to fail, Moody’s upgraded them all to triple-A ratings in early 2007 (Moody’s, 2007). This implicit state guarantee led to a massive miscalculation of risk.  We  now  know  that  the  banks  had  grown  far  too  big  to  rescue.  Still,  at the time nothing seemed to slake their ever greater thirst for growth. In August 2007, when the Credit Crunch was already biting, Kaupthing announced  a  planned  acquisition  of  Dutch  bank  NIBC  for  €3  billion,  which  would  double  its  already  overblown  balance  sheet.  Kaupthing  was  considered  to  be  in  quite  good  shape.  Only  a  month  earlier,  it  had  won  Euromoney’s  Award  for  Excellence,  which  was  reckoned  to  be  the  most  prestigious  award  in  the  global  banking  industry,  and  Kaupthing was declared the best bank in the Nordic region (Kaupthing Best Bank, 2007).  Already by late 2006, demand for Icelandic bonds had risen again inter-nationally  and  the  Central  Bank  was  gradually  able  to  build  currency  reserves.  By  2008,  available  foreign  cash  had  doubled  since  the  mini-crisis.  Still,  despite  successfully  fending  off  the  2006  Geyser  Crisis  and  even after accumulating this massive growth, the Icelandic banks were never fully able to shake off the CDS spread, which stubbornly remained ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":106,"content":"96   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisbetween 30 and 40 per cent higher than the CDS premiums on financial firms with similar ratings elsewhere. This, however, only caused minor irritation on the market.  Though the international press was increasingly referring to Icelandic businessmen as Viking raiders, they were being celebrated at home, as if they were the nation’s true representatives – rather like a national foot-ball team that had succeeded against all the odds to win the World Cup. The domestic reporting might have been influenced by the fact that, like most  other  sectors  of  the  economy,  the  media  was  also  dominated  by  the three banking groups, each of which controlled a major publishing house.  The  country’s  only  broadsheet  newspaper,    Morgunblaðið ,  and  the largest web-based news portal, mbl.is, were owned by Landsbanki’s Björgólfur  Guðmundsson.  Glitnir’s  Jón  Ásgeir  Jóhannesson  controlled  the  largest  private  media  company,  365,  which  printed  the  coun-try’s  largest  daily,    Fréttablaðið ,  distributed  free  to  all  households,  and  controlled  the  main  private  TV  channel,  Stöð  2,  which  was  the  only  one  that  could  compete  with  the  state  broadcaster.  The  much  smaller   Viðskiptablaðið , Iceland’s equivalent to the  Financial Times , was held by people of the Kaupthing clan.  The public at large seemed quite content with the state of the economy, as  the  entire  nation  was  believed  to  be  benefitting  from  the  boom.  Iceland was reported as having become one of the richest countries in the world. Our income was ranked the fifth highest, 60 per cent higher than that of the US. By 2008, Iceland had reached the top of the United Nations  Development  index  (United  Nations,  2008).  In  line  with  the  tags given to the booming economies in Asia in the 1990s and to Ireland around  the  millennium,  Iceland  was  being  branded  the  Nordic  Tiger.  Most of us, however, never fully understood the basis of our newfound wealth. In fact, we were gradually becoming oblivious to the risk of debt. Iceland was a prime example of a prosperous society blithely living well beyond its means.  Optimism  was  at  its  peak  when  the  poles  of  Icelandic  politics,  the  Independence Party (IP) and the Social Democratic Alliance (SDA), buried their hatchets and entered into a new broad-based coalition in the spring of 2007. Perhaps it tells a larger story that the Ministry for Commerce, which was responsible for banking, was as a result of the coalition treated as  a  junior  ministry  and  handed  to  the  most  inexperienced  minister,  Björgvin Sigurðsson, who held a BA in Philosophy and had never in his career shown much interest in either business or banking.  Trouble started even during the honeymoon period of the new govern-ment. In autumn 2007, the sub-prime housing bubble burst in the US, ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":107,"content":"Hot Air – Living on the Edge 97causing  concern  throughout  the  international  economy.  Even  though  our banks had not invested much in financial assets holding US housing bonds, Iceland was still extremely vulnerable to any international down-turn. Other crisis-ridden states – Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the Baltic countries – had all experienced capital inflow in the boom years with  credit-inflated  growth.  All  enjoyed  high  investment,  increased  construction and high asset prices. The scale of all these, however, was greater in Iceland. In fact, our business model relied on constant boom.    Gathering clouds (early 2008)  In early 2008, the massive capital inflow of 2003 to 2007 reversed, as it did in other high-yield countries like the Baltics, Greece, Portugal and Spain. The carry trade, which had helped to keep the lid on inflation by hiking the value of the króna, was now leaving our economy exposed to nervous reversal. Amounting to 40 per cent of GDP, steep reversal was threatening a sharp devaluation, falling output and rapidly rising unem-ployment. The banks were finding it ever more difficult to access funds. The tide was already turning on New Year’s Day.  Economists William Buiter and Ann Sibert (2008) delivered a commis-sioned  report  for  Landsbanki  in  which  they  claimed  that  it  was  ‘abso-lutely obvious’ that the ‘banking model was not viable’. The total liability of  the  banking  system  was  approaching  750  per  cent  of  the  country’s  GDP.  Foreign  liabilities  were  five  times  GDP.  Because  of  the  sensitivity  of  its  content,  the  report  was  kept  confidential  until  after  The  Crash.  Morgan  Stanley,  however,  publicly  reported  similar  concerns:  that  Iceland’s financial system was unsustainable (Ineke & Borgstrom, 2008). More and more reports were mentioning the lack of credible lenders of last  resort.  Already  by  the  end  of  2007,  short-term  loans  amounted  to  15 times the Central Bank’s foreign reserve. Around this time, the first investment company, Gnúpur, fell, causing attention beyond Iceland’s border. The negative reporting upset Kaupthing’s plan to acquire NIBC and the unfinished deal was finally abandoned in early autumn 2008, leaving  Kaupthing  even  more  vulnerable  than  before  and  seriously  calling its credibility into question.  By  the  end  of  January,  a  select  few  amongst  the  Icelandic  banking  community learned that an attack was under way. They had been invited to the bar at the trendy downtown Reykjavik 101 Hotel to meet a group of hedge fund managers visiting Iceland on a trip which they believed had  been  organized  by  Bear  Stern  and  Merrill  Lynch.  When  the  cold,  dark winter night set in and the champagne bottles multiplied on the ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":108,"content":"98   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisshiny black granite table in front of them, they learned that their visi-tors were shorting both the króna and the banks in the CDS market. In a drunken haze, some of the visitors couldn’t refrain from bragging of their plot to take down Iceland. In the hedge fund world, taking down an entire country is much more gratifying than merely killing off a private company. During the small hours of 1 February, the bankers nervously sneaked out of the party and rushed back to their headquarters to report on what they had learned. It soon became evident that the attack had been in planning for months. Many of Iceland’s old acquaintances from the 2006 mini-crisis were back; silently, they had again been building up a massive short position. Apparently, many domestic shareholders had been willing to lend the foreign hedge funds their shares for up to a 30 per cent premium.  Soon after the pack of hard-partying hedge fund managers had departed, a flood of critical reports landed on our shores. Before February was out, Bear  Stern  (2008)  analysts,  for  example,  compared  Iceland’s  economy  with that of Kazakhstan, with a recommendation to go short. A series of such negative reports ran through the international media, often using similar phrasing or wording, which raised suspicion of unified action in feeding these stories to the press.  Our limited foreign reserves of 15 per cent of GDP would not go far to  back  up  liabilities  in  foreign  currency  that  amounted  to  five  times  the  country’s  GDP.  Iceland’s  financial  situation  was  unsustainable.  Moody’s  was  questioning  Iceland’s  triple  A-ratings  and  consequently  downgraded Landsbanki and Glitnir (Cailleteau, 2008). The CDS spread on  all  Icelandic  banks  was  rapidly  growing  again,  while  Iceland  was  getting short of liquidity. Pressure was building fast. Despite the Central Bank’s efforts – for example, in keeping a 10 per cent interest differen-tial – the króna fell sharply in early March when Bear Stern fell and the stock  market  took  a  significant  hit  as  the  banks’  stocks  dropped.  This  also created problems for the main holding companies, which by then owned most businesses in the country. If one firm were to fall, there was a real danger of a domino effect wiping out the entire corporate sector.  During  the  2006  Geyser  Crisis,  a  CDS  premium  of  hundred  points  above  Libor  caused  grave  concern.  In  late  March  2008,  the  CDS  was  ten  times  higher  than  that.  Interestingly  for  what  was  to  occur  later,  the  spread  on  Landsbanki  was  significantly  lower  than  on  the  other  two  because  of  the  perceived  success  of  the  Icesave  deposit  accounts,  applauded by the rating agencies.  One reason for the króna falling at what seemed to be regular intervals was that the banks were hedging their foreign assets against it – against ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":109,"content":"Hot Air – Living on the Edge 99their  own  currency.  The  linkage  between  the  banks’  liquidity  position  and the rate of the króna was evident. Most of their assets and liabilities were in foreign currency. For a while, they had thus been lobbying for being allowed to operate their accounts in euros in order to smooth out currency  fluctuations,  which  were  distorting  their  books.  The  govern-ment, however, always stood against that, as it was seen as strengthening the argument of those campaigning for joining the EU and entering the Eurozone.  The Icelandic banks were obviously in serious trouble. Although they had  clearly  far  outgrown  the  state,  the  government’s  policy  was  still  to keep the banks domiciled in Iceland. After all, they were the back-bone to Iceland’s new economy, allowing us not only to underpin our economic  independence  but  also  to  further  strengthen  the  collective  Icelandic  Project.  This  can  help  to  explain  the  government’s  vituper-ative  response  to  foreign  critics.  Cabinet  ministers  were  now  getting  involved,  accusing  foreign  hedge  funds  of  a  speculative  attack  and  threatening  direct  government  intervention  in  the  currency  market  and the stock market. Iceland might not possess large currency reserves, but  the  state  was  virtually  debt  free  and  could,  with  the  help  of  its  neighbours,  beat  back  these  rogue  attackers,  who  would  as  a  result  suffer significant losses. In a sort of roadshow on behalf of the Icelandic banks, Prime Minister Geir Haarde headed for New York while Foreign Minister  Ingibjörg  Gísladóttir  promoted  the  banks  in  Copenhagen.  The  chairman  of  the  governors’  board  of  the  Central  Bank,  Mr  Davíð  Oddsson, also asserted that the banking system was essentially sound (Central Bank of Iceland, 2008).  Ironically, however, the hard-partying visitors from Merrill Lynch and Bear  Stern,  who  in  January  had  boasted  of  their  plot  of  taking  down  Iceland in the trendy Reykjavik 101 Hotel bar, were by then gone from the  scene.  Both  firms  had  already  fallen  victim  to  the  Credit  Crunch  and been taken over by others. Independent researchers were by now, however,  also  reporting  predictions  of  Iceland’s  downfall.  In  April,  for  example,  Daniel  Gros,  from  the  Centre  for  European  Policy  Studies  in  Brussels,  wondered  if  Iceland  was  already  on  the  brink  (Gros,  2008).  Around the same time, Standard & Poor’s indicated that Iceland, Estonia and  Latvia  were  the  ‘most  vulnerable  European  countries  to  a  global  slowdown’  (Anderson,  2008).  By  now  Iceland  was  in  international  media no longer grouped with the other Nordics but rather with newly independent Eastern European and former Soviet states.  The  lesson  learned  from  the  2006  mini-crisis  was  to  keep  calm  and  weather  the  storm.  At  first  it  seem  to  work.  In  spring  2008,  the  CDS  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":110,"content":"100   Iceland and the International Financial Crisispremium finally fell to between 200 and 300 points above Libor. This is perhaps why, despite ever-increasing margin calls, for increased collat-eral, the bankers were reluctant to sell off assets at a discount price to alleviate the liquidity pressure. Viewed from the experience of the mini-crisis, the worst seemed to be over and bankers and officials alike were uttering sighs of relief. We now know, however, that this was only the calm before the storm.  This  time  the  situation  was  different.  The  banks  were  much  more  vulnerable  than  before.  Landsbanki  had  for  a  while  enjoyed  better  ratings than the other two because it was able to tap into the Icesave deposits  to  keep  liquidity  flowing.  This  was,  however,  a  mixed  blessing, as reliance on deposits leaves a bank much more vulnerable to bad news than if it is funded in the wholesale market. Even a minor issue can result in a run if it is portrayed in the wrong light. The next alarm came in June, when Professor Robert Aliber (2008) of Chicago University gave a talk in Reykjavik on Iceland’s economic turbulence, describing an unsustainable credit and asset bubble. When answering a  question  from  the  audience,  Aliber  is  reported  to  have  predicted  the collapse of the banks before the end of the year. Around the same time,  all  three  banks  were  passing  the  FME’s  stress  tests  with  flying  colours.  In  theory,  the  banks  were  still  doing  well.  Amongst  those  buying this story was the  Financial Times , which as late as August 2008 wrote  that  ‘fears  of  a  systemic  financial  crisis  in  Iceland  have  dissi-pated after the country’s three main banks announced second-quarter results showing that they are suffering amid the downturn – but not too badly’ (Ibson, 2008).  The  system  was,  however,  evidently  becoming  ever  weaker.  One  example  lies  in  how  the  banks  met  creditors’  demands  for  increased  collateral  as  share  prices  fell.  One  of  Kaupthing’s  largest  owners,  for  example,  had  financed  his  stakes  with  funding  from  Citi  Bank,  which  was demanding increased collateral as Kaupthing’s stock was falling. To protect its owner, Kaupthing simply lent him the money to pay Citi. One of its largest owners was thus funding almost his entire stake from his own bank. Landsbanki turned a similar favour to a company run by one of its owners to pay a margin call from Deutsche Bank. Another inter-esting  example  of  market  manipulation  leading  up  to  The  Crash  was  the so-called Al-Thani case. In September 2008, Kaupthing announced that Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al-Thani of Qatar had bought a 5 per cent stake in the bank for $285 million. The investment was claimed to  indicate  strength  and  the  bank’s  promising  outlook  (Davíðsdóttir,  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":111,"content":"Hot Air – Living on the Edge 1012012). Only much later did it become known that bank lent him the full amount, most of which with no other collateral than the shares them-selves. The Sheikh wasn’t risking much his own money.  The Central Bank stretched itself to the limit to keep the banks liqui-dated  in  domestic  króna,  for  example  accepting  their  own  bonds  as  collateral  –  the  so-called  love  letters.  However,  to  back  up  the  overin-flated  banking  system  in  such  dire  straits  it  needed  a  sizable  sum  in  foreign currency. The Central Bank thus went knocking on doors in the neighbouring  capitals  asking  to  open  swap  lines  that  could  be  drawn  on  in  time  of  need.  This  was  meant  to  boost  confidence  in  Iceland’s  capacity to back up the financial system. To the surprise of the govern-ment,  however,  it  met  closed  doors  in  most  places.  Not  only  had  our  banks  been  pushed  out  of  the  international  capital  market,  but  our  government had as well. Iceland first approached the Bank of England in  March  2008.  Initially,  the  request  was  positively  received,  but  with  a  suggestion  that  the  IMF  would  analyse  the  need.  A  month  later,  the  climate  had  changed.  It  had  become  clear  that  the  central  banks  of  Europe, the US and the UK had collectively decided not to assist Iceland. We later learned that the governor of the Bank of England, Mervin King, offered instead to co-ordinate a multinational effort to help scale down our financial system. His offer was instantly turned down by the leading governor  of  the  Icelandic  Central  Bank,  Mr  Davíð  Oddsson,  thus  only  adding to Iceland’s subsequent isolation.  For  the  international  financial  system  tiny  Iceland  was  as  a  state  not thought to be too big to fail. We thus found ourselves quite alone in  world,  desperately  trotting  the  globe  looking  for  money.  In  May,  Norway,  Sweden  and  Denmark  finally  agreed  on  a  borrowing  line,  for  €500 million each. This, however, was only on offer at an unprecedented cost: the neighbouring states would dictate a strict fiscal reform, which our  government  was  to  implement  at  home,  including  changing  the  Housing  Financing  Fund,  more  responsible  budgeting  and  changes  in  union  contracts  (Hreinsson  et  al.,  2010).  Though  the  proposed  reform  was never implemented, this was the most drastic foreign interference in  our  domestic  affairs  since  independence  in  1944  and  was  indeed  a  serious threat to our cherished sovereignty.  A loan of €2 billion was also being negotiated with JP Morgan but this was abandoned in June as the interest rate, at 185 points above Libor, was thought too high. By July, all funding possibilities seemed to have been exhausted and the CDS premium on the banks rose again as the rate of critical reporting increased exponentially.  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":112,"content":"102   Iceland and the International Financial Crisis  Falling off the waterfall  While Landsbanki and Kaupthing were in late summer 2008 still battling through this extremely troubled water, for example by extracting liquidity from their foreign deposit schemes over the internet, Glitnir was having more  serious  difficulties  in  keeping  its  head  above  the  surface.  Glitnir  came late to the game of tapping into high-yielding internet savings and was not fully up and running with its scheme when the bank ran into trouble. Its so-called Save&Save deposit accounts had been tried out in Norway but were not properly implemented in time to liquidate the bank when wholesale borrowing was fast drying up, and they were available only for a very short time against sky-high interest. With €600 million loan maturing on 15 October, totalling €1.5 billion in late 2008 and in early 2009, the management was worried it might not be able to jump all  the  hurdles  in  time.  Its  funding  model  had  failed.  Selling  assets  at  discount  prices  now  seemed  unavoidable.  Fortunately,  they  thought,  the bank had some solid assets in Norway to sell or borrow against.  This already grim outlook blackened fast when American investment bank  giant  Lehman  Brothers  collapsed  on  15  September.  Although  the  Icelandic  banks  had  only  small  exposure  in  Lehman,  around  €150 million, the shockwave that ran through the entire global finan-cial  system  with  its  collapse  instantly  dried  up  the  little  liquidity  that  was left to the Icelandic banks. What was worse, markets for financial assets froze. Subsequently, the króna took one of its repeated nosedives and CDSs on the Icelandic banks shot through the roof, rising by almost half,  to  reach  1,000  points  above  Libor.  Still,  after  securing  an  exten-sion  on  a  €150  million  loan  from  the  German  Bayerische  Landesbank  in  the  wake  of  Lehman’s  demise,  Glitnir’s  management  was  confident  of being able to survive long enough past the mid-October deadline for short-term borrowing on international markets to become available to them again. Weak owners were, however, not helping. These were the most highly exposed investment companies, who relied on Glitnir for funding when suffering heavy losses in the equity market and facing an increased flow of margin calls.  After an eventful week weathering this unprecedented storm, Glitnir finally had the wind taken out of its sails when it learned that the Central Bank had quietly taken out €300 million from the same German bank, thereby thus filling its quota for Iceland. When, in panic, Glitnir’s repre-sentative called Munich to confirm its previous negotiated agreement, the Bayerische Landesbank referred him straight to the Icelandic Central Bank.  Emergency  money  was  no  longer  available  to  them  in  Bavaria.  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":113,"content":"Hot Air – Living on the Edge 103Finally, it dawned on the bank’s management that its own Central Bank had in effect stolen its only lifeline.  With €600 million maturing in three weeks’ time, the bank was about to  fall  off  the  waterfall.  Clearly,  it  would  survive  neither  the  fall  nor  the swirling waters below. There were no good options. With the dead-line impending, the chairman of the board, Þorsteinn Már Baldursson, decided that the bank must go to the Central Bank to ask for help – after all, the Central Bank had stolen its loan from Bayerische. Perhaps they could have part of it? This was a dramatic decision, which would have grave consequences not only for Glitnir but also for the entire banking system.  To understand some of the peculiarities of Icelandic politics one has to  examine  personal  relationships.  When  resigning  his  post  as  Prime  Minister  in  2004,  Davíð  Oddsson,  the  instrumental  force  behind  the  neoliberal  regime  created  in  the  1990s  and  early  2000s,  in  effect  appointed himself the governor of the Central Bank, taking up the posi-tion in 2005. By then, he was already at odds with many of the Viking Capitalists  who  controlled  the  banks.  In  an  extraordinary  move,  he  had in 2003, when still the PM, publicly withdrawn his deposits from Kaupthing in protest over management excesses, thus hinting a run on the bank. His rivalry with Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson, however, ran much deeper, starting when Jóhannesson, together with few colleagues in the Orca group, acquired the FBA investment bank in 1998, as described in the previous chapter. At the height of their quarrel, Oddsson had in a TV interview called Jóhannesson, by then Iceland’s most powerful busi-nessman, a ‘street hooligan’ (quoted in Jóhannesson, 2002). In an inter-view in 2003, Oddsson claimed that Jóhannesson, had through a mutual colleague,  offered  him  300  million  króna  to  keep  off  his  back  (quoted  in  Friðriksson,  2003).  Incredibly,  this  accusation  was  never  properly  examined, leaving it still unclear whether Iceland’s most powerful busi-nessman had tried to bribe the PM or whether our PM was fabricating this serious accusation in order to ruin Jóhannesson’s credibility.  Vital  to  the  story  of  Glitnir’s  takedown  in  autumn  2008  is  that  one  of  Jóhannesson’s  fellow  Orca  group  investors  in  the  1998  FBA  takeover  was  Þorsteinn  Már  Baldursson,  by  now  chairman  of  Glitnir.  Baldvinsson  headed  Iceland’s  largest  fishing  vessel  corporation,  in  the  north  of  Iceland,  and  had  until  the  FBA  takeover  been  close  to  the  IP  establishment. Established knowledge has it that Oddsson never forgets an  enemy.  It  is  reported  that  when  Baldvinsson  suggested  going  to  the Central Bank for help in September 2008, Jóhannesson, who led the pack of the bank’s largest owners, was, to say the least, uneasy with the ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":114,"content":"104   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisdecision,  fearing  that  his  long-standing  enemy,  now  in  the  governor’s  chair,  would  seize  the  opportunity  and  snatch  the  bank  from  under  them – perhaps just as Jóhannesson had done himself in the FBA deal. By the end of the month, when everything was gone, Jóhannesson (2008) spoke of his fears in a TV interview. Baldvinsson, however, still believed that his old, cosy relationship with the IP leadership would prevent such an act of pure revenge. On the evening of Wednesday 24 September, the chairman  called  for  a  meeting  with  Oddsson  the  following  morning.  Other board members of Glitnir nervously waited at the headquarters of the Stoðir holding company, from which through Jóhannesson and his colleagues in effect controlled Glitnir.  In  the  lead-up  to  all  this,  the  media  got  wind  of  something  going  wrong. An increased volume of reports discussed the until then unthink-able possibility that one of the banks would collapse or be taken over by one of the others. All sorts of scenarios were being discussed. Since early 2008, many plans had been discussed for the others to acquire Glitnir and split its assets. In order to prevent the unthinkable, the government reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  the  banks.  Prime  Minister  Geir  Haarde  had for a long time been Oddsson’s number two before occupying his seat as chairman of the IP in 2004 and becoming Prime Minister in 2007. He repeatedly announced that the state would indeed back up the banks if  they  were  ever  in  trouble.  On  Saturday  20  September  the  leader  of  the SDA, Foreign Minister Ingibjörg Gísladóttir (2008a) asserted that the financial  system  was  sound  and  the  government  would  surely  back  it  up if necessary. In a TV interview on Sunday 21 September, the CEO of Glitnir,  Lárus  Welding  (2008),  confidently  stated  that  the  bank’s  posi-tion  was  strong.  Most  of  the  banks  were  indeed  arguing  that,  having  learned from the 2006 mini-crisis and since taken precautionary meas-ures,  they  were  now  well  equipped  to  weather  the  storm  that  would  soon hit them.  Despite  these  bold  statements  to  the  press,  Glitnir’s  immediate  trouble  was  worrying  all  the  banks.  The  writing  on  the  wall  was  becoming  evident.  Through  cross-lending  and  cross-ownership  they  had  all  become  interdependent.  The  owners  of  the  banks  were  also  their  largest  borrowers,  as  was  later  mapped  out  in  the  SIC  report  (Hreinsson   et   al.,   2010:   ch.   9.6).   Jóhannesson’s   family’s   holding   company, Baugur, for example, owed all of them far more than any of them would survive losing. In Glitnir alone, Baugur’s credit amounted to  half  of  the  bank’s  regulatory  capital  (Nielsson  &  Torfason,  2012).  Caught   in   this   incestuous   relationship,   the   Icelandic   banks   were   increasingly  being  viewed  abroad  as  almost  one  entity.  The  demise  of  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":115,"content":"Hot Air – Living on the Edge 105Glitnir would thus almost certainly bring the other two down as well. The threat of a domino effect was imminent.    The Glitnir takedown  In   the   morning   of   Thursday   25   September,   Glitnir’s   chairman,   Mr  Baldvinsson,  headed  to  the  Central  Bank  headquarters  in  central  Reykjavik  to  meet  its  governor.  The  meeting  had  to  be  secretive  so  as  not to trigger any reporting, which could result in a run on the bank in this extremely sensitive situation. Glitnir was now at the mercy of the Central Bank – Jóhannesson’s business survival was thus in the hands of his old enemy, Oddsson. When sneaking through the bank’s corridors, Baldvinsson was still relatively optimistic that the Central Bank would help. Glitnir was, he thought, offering good assets as collateral against an  emergency  loan  of  €600  million.  By  Icelandic  standards,  however,  this  amount  was  astronomical:  one-third  of  the  bank’s  entire  foreign  reserve as it stood the month before.  At  this  time,  the  Central  Bank  was  busy  on  many  fronts.  Two  days  earlier, the news had broken that central banks in the other Nordics had negotiated  swap  lines  with  the  US  Federal  Reserve.  Our  Central  Bank  was having grave difficulties explaining why Iceland had been left out of the deal – the one of the Nordic five that clearly needed it the most. Flatly  refused  such  access,  Iceland  was  now  the  only  state  in  Western  Europe  without  a  swap  line  to  the  Fed.  Trading  in  króna  had  in  effect  frozen,  as  there  was  no  demand  for  it.  This  same  Thursday,  while  the  Central  Bank  was  still  contemplating  Glitnir’s  request,  the  US  invest-ment  bank  Washington  Mutual  was  taken  into  administration.  As  the  bank  defaulted,  its  deposits  were  saved  when  ushered  to  JP  Morgan.  This  is  significant,  as  it  later  served  as  the  template  for  the  Icelandic  situation.  Throughout  Thursday  and  by  closing  time  on  Friday  26  September,  Glitnir owners could not get through to the Central Bank to learn about the fate of the request for an emergency loan. It is revealing that during these few days the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were with many key government officials in New York promoting Iceland’s bid for a seat on  the  UN  Security  Council.  The  government’s  leaders  seemed  obliv-ious to the seriousness of the domestic troubles ahead. While PM Geir Haarde was in ceremony ringing the closing bell on Nasdaq in New York, Glitnir’s  board  was  holding  an  emergency  meeting  with  his  Central  Bank  in  Reykjavik.  Only  on  Friday  evening  did  Oddsson  finally  call  Haarde to fill him in on the sensitive situation. Cutting his trip short, ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":116,"content":"106   Iceland and the International Financial CrisisHaarde rushed home the same evening, telling his coalition partner and Foreign  Minister,  Mrs  Gísladóttir,  nothing.  She  thus  remained  in  New  York, along with the other SDA ministers, oblivious to anything being wrong back home. Not only was the leader of the other coalition party left  out  of  the  information  loop  amid  fear  of  the  country’s  financial  system tanking, but even more dramatically for her personally, a tumour was  found  in  her  brain  after  she  fainted  while  in  New  York.  Just  days  before  Iceland’s  most  dramatic  events,  on  a  global  scale,  the  Foreign  Minister and leader of one of the two coalition parties was rushed to the operating table in New York.  Meanwhile, the króna kept on sinking and the markets were becoming ever more volatile. Reporters were getting wind of something being seri-ously wrong and were sniffing around the banks and the government, without,  however,  finding  much  to  chew  on.  On  Saturday  afternoon,  the  Central  Bank’s  governor  was  briefing  the  PM  and  his  aides  on  his  plans.  Reportedly,  the  PM  sat  quietly  in  the  Central  Bank’s  meeting  room, listening without voicing objections. The reader should keep in mind  that  this  was  not  simply  the  Central  Bank’s  governor  debriefing  his PM and awaiting the assessment of the country’s leader, but rather a political lion giving his old protégé the heads up. By now, Oddsson was in the driving seat.  Ironically,  Sunday  proved  to  be  a  great  PR  success  for  Glitnir,  which  sponsored  the  Oslo  marathon.  Red  flags  with  Glitnir’s  logo  were  flying  high above the streets of Norway’s capital this eventful Sunday. Norway’s princess, Mette Marit, was one of five thousand runners wearing Glitnir’s red running shirts, which would shine brightly in Norway’s media. Back in  Reykjavik,  however,  Oddsson  was  by  now  completing  his  plan.  SDA  ministers were still not yet involved. Mutual animosity between Oddsson and the SDA Minister for Commerce, Mr Björgvin Sigurðsson, was such that they could not occupy the same room – the governor of the Central Bank and the minister responsible for banking were not on speaking terms. The  word  was,  however,  getting  out  that  Glitnir  was  in  serious  trouble.  Worried that Glitnir’s downfall would bring the others with it, Landsbanki was desperately proposing an instant merger of all the banks with govern-ment backing. Kaupthing’s management was proposing a similar scenario. Distrust  amongst  the  bankers  and  between  them,  the  government  and  the Central Bank, however, prevented them from reaching an agreement in time. Finally, in the late afternoon, SDA ministers were informed and in the late evening the opposition heard the news.  Throughout the weekend, Glitnir’s board and managers were increas-ingly  impatiently  waiting  for  the  Central  Bank’s  reply.  After  being  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":117,"content":"Hot Air – Living on the Edge 107rebuffed  for  days,  they  were  finally  called  to  the  bank  on  late  Sunday  evening.  When  meeting  reporters  in  the  lobby  they  could  before  the  meeting  started  tell  the  answer  to  their  request  for  emergency  loan.  Inside  the  Central  Bank’s  top-floor  meeting  room,  Oddsson  had  laid  out the only deal on offer. The Central Bank would indeed provide the money needed – not as loan, however, but as equity, for a 75 per cent controlling  stake  in  the  bank.  Glitnir  was  to  be  de  facto  nationalized,  leaving  only  25  per  cent  for  its  owners,  who  would  lose  88  per  cent  worth  of  their  shears  in  the  takeover.  Oddsson  dictated  that  Glitnir’s  owners were to give their answer before the opening of the markets in the morning. He had already planned a press meeting for that time to announce  the  deal.  Stunned  by  the  offer,  Glitnir’s  owners  rushed  in  panic  back  to  the  bank’s  headquarters,  where  more  reporters  awaited  them.  The  game  was  up.  There  was  no  time  to  find  alternative  solu-tions. A run on the bank would surely start when the doors opened in the  morning.  Chased  by  the  media  throughout  the  night,  the  bank’s  board duly threw in the towel at break of dawn on Monday morning. Jóhannesson  has  said  that  this  was  the  world’s  greatest  bank  robbery  (Jóhannesson, 2008). His worst fears of what Oddsson might be cooking up in the days after Glitnir came knocking on the Central Bank’s door had come true.  Oddsson’s plan was based on his belief that the perceived strength of the state would provide a nationalized Glitnir with enough credibility to be able to weather the storm and eventually make for a fantastic return to the state’s coffers. Initially, it seemed to work. American Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman for example announced his approval (Krugman,  2008).  Soon,  however,  the  contrary  became  apparent.  The  perceived weakness of Glitnir instead created increased vulnerability for the state, which had taken over the bank’s responsibilities. The Icelandic state  was  subsequently  downgraded  by  international  rating  agencies,  together with the other banks. Another flaw in the plan was becoming ever more visible. The loss of 75 per cent of its shares in Glitnir and 88 per cent of their worth according to the new price tag instantly bank-rupted  holding  company  Stoðir,  which  had  by  now  become  one  of  the major assets of Jóhannesson’s Baugur group. It is reported that the Central  Bank’s  economists  were  in  panic  and  disbelief,  shouting  their  heads  off  when,  in  their  separate  offices,  they  read  about  the  deal  via  domestic  internet  news  outlets.  Neither  they  nor  other  specialists  had  been involved in drafting the plan, and they had therefore not had the opportunity to voice their concerns of a domino effect running through the economy, which easily could ruin the country’s financial sector.

When the news sank in, a silent run started on the banks and the króna went into free fall while the tsunami wave rose all around Iceland’s shores.    Conclusion  By end of September 2008, Iceland’s banks were on the brink of collapse. The total liability of the banking system had reached almost ten times the country’s GDP. Trouble started with the mini-crisis of 2006, which Iceland was barely able to shake off. Instead of downscaling the system and tightening controls, the banks were on the contrary allowed to more than double in size. We now know that by January 2008, the system was unsustainable.  Its  inherent  systemic  weakness  lay  in  the  operation  of  large international banks in a small currency regime. A series of mistakes were also made in the lead-up to The Crash, some of the most serious ones  mostly  because  of  personal  animosity  and  grievances  –  perhaps  most significantly because of lack of trust.  All roads in this saga seem to have led towards the edge of the cliff: the government’s privatization, deregulation and procyclycal economic poli-cies; the ever increasing interconnectedness of the banks and ever more condensed groups of corporations; the risk-seeking behaviour of private corporations  with  diminished  cushions  against  risk;  and  the  global  rating agencies’ upgrades of our banks to triple-A ratings. No significant measure was taken to cool the economy and no ventilation built into the machine. The Central Bank lost control of the supply of money when the banks started borrowing wholesale abroad. Furthermore, there was a systemic fault built into the system, as it is extremely difficult for public authorities  to  control  the  money  supply  and  asset  price  inflation  and  to  curb  demand  when  operating  a  free-floating  independent  currency.  When small states operate a free-flow monetary policy, they need to be able  to  control  the  inflow  and  avoid  the  risk  of  a  rapid  reversal.  One  measure would be to tax inflow and outflow.  No such preventive measures were taken. On the contrary, practices used to fend off the troubles in the 2006 mini-crisis created weak equity in the banks, leaving them in even more trouble when liquidity dried up. Collectively, this can only be attributed to proactive public policies and  the  seriously  low  quality  of  banking  supervision  in  the  country.  In fact, the national identity celebrated risk-taking behaviour, as rapid growth served the collective task of broadening the base of the economy to  underpin  the  Icelandic  Project.

This concern was, however, never raised – not by the FME, nor by the Central Bank,  nor  by  the  Ministry  of  Commerce.  Neither  was  it,  until  March  2008,  seriously  discussed  in  the  host  countries  where  the  Icelandic  banks were operating under home-backed protection. The danger of an oversized banking system relative to the state was mostly ignored.  When the crisis was tightening its grip, our cherished sovereignty was also being threatened. Strict conditions for very limited swap lines with the Nordics in spring 2008 meant that Iceland was no longer sovereign when it came to economic governance. This was traumatic for Iceland’s postcolonial national identity. Leading up to the collapse, Iceland found itself being further isolated. In September 2008, for example, the govern-ment  was  unable  to  negotiate  swap  lines  with  the  US  Federal  Reserve  along  with  the  other  Nordics.  Iceland  was  instead,  in  what  seemed  a  co-ordinated  action  by  its  neighbours,  pushed  towards  the  IMF.  The  dream of being a fully functioning and successful modern state, recog-nized as an equal partner with other states in the West, was turning into a nightmare.  When Glitnir ran into trouble in September 2008, there was no effec-tive  plan  in  place  to  deal  with  such  a  crisis,  leaving  it  to  chance  what  the response would be. In the next chapter I examine the events of the October 2008 Crash.     ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":120,"content":"110   In  the  late  afternoon  of  Monday  6  October  2008,  Prime  Minister  Geir  Haarde  addressed  the  nation  on  TV:  the  state  would  not  be  able  to  bail  out  the  banks.  Over  the  following  three  days,  the  entire  financial  system collapsed – Landsbanki on Tuesday, Glitnir on Wednesday and finally Kaupthing on Thursday. The Central Bank’s decision to acquire a controlling stake in Glitnir, as described in the previous chapter, finally tipped the scales in this extremely volatile situation and caused a domino effect, which wiped out the country’s banking system.  When the overinflated bubble finally burst in early October, Iceland not only was financially ruined but also found itself alone in the world. This  rapidly  growing  international  banking  hub  was  now  reduced  to  being  an  isolated  rock  in  the  North  Atlantic  –  once  again.  The  UK  government  invoked  Anti-Terrorist  legislation  to  freeze  all  Icelandic  assets in Britain and the entire international society forced the Icelandic state  to  accept  responsibility  for  foreign  branches  of  the  fallen  banks  before allowing the IMF to open doors to emergency loans. The hostile response  of  foreign  actors,  mainly  the  UK  government,  induced  an  increase  in  bunker  mentality  within  Iceland,  where  this  proud  island  people felt victimized in the whole horrifying saga.    Domino effect  When  news  broke  on  Monday  29  September  of  de  facto  nationaliza-tion of Glitnir, a slow run started on all Icelandic banks. By lunchtime, the holding company Stoðir, one of the Jóhannesson’s Baugur Group’s largest  assets,  asked  for  a  moratorium.  Its  equity  was  in  ruins  when  shares  in  Glitnir  instantly  fell  by  88  per  cent.

The same was true of the country’s pension funds, which had invested heavily in the banks. Many ordinary people who  had  in  the  past  kept  a  large  part  of  their  savings  in  bank  shares  would also be devastated.  In  the  neighbouring  states,  governments  were  frantically  bailing  out their banks, though by different means. The Irish government, for example, issued a blanket guarantee for all its banks for two years; in the UK, Bradford & Bingley was split, with deposits whisked over to Abbey National;  and  the  Benelux  three  bailed  out  Fortis  in  a  joint  action.  Meanwhile,  many  measures  were  taken  in  the  US,  where  collapsing  banks were rescued by rushing them under the wings of others. At the same  time,  however,  it  was  gradually  becoming  painfully  evident  that  Iceland did not have the means to do the same.  Liquidity had finally dried up when Lehman fell in September 2008. By then, the total liability of the Icelandic banking system had almost reached  ten  times  the  country’s  GDP,  most  of  it  in  foreign  currency  (Halldórsson  &  Zoega,  2010).  Deposits  in  foreign  branches  alone  were  close  to  the  country’s  GDP  and  seven  times  higher  than  the  entire  currency reserve. Unlike most other countries, Iceland thus did not have a  credible  lender  of  last  resort.  Illustrative  of  Iceland’s  trouble  was  the  fact that apart from the Zimbabwe dollar, our króna had in the preceding year fallen more than any other currency in the word. With inflation on the rampage, many would not be able to meet the increased payments on  their  inflation-indexed  housing  loans  or  foreign  exchange-indexed  car loans, which had become common in most vehicle purchases.  Already by opening of business on the Monday morning, when news of  Glitnir’s  nationalization  broke,  depositors  were  flocking  to  their  nearest  branch  and  withdrawing  their  savings.  When  the  news  trav-elled abroad, many of the 300,000 Icesave depositors rushed online to withdraw their money. Worries over internet banks were worldwide, but the  Icelandic  internet  banking  schemes  were  now  viewed  as  toxic,  as  many considered the Icelandic banks almost a single entity. Quite a few Kaupthing Edge depositors were thus also withdrawing their cash, even though Edge accounts fell under the UK’s Depositors Guarantee Scheme. At home, our politicians were having trouble convincing depositors that their  money  was  safe.  Announcements  that  the  government  would  in  the event of default step in and protect ordinary savings were initially too vaguely worded. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":122,"content":"112   Iceland and the International Financial Crisis On Tuesday morning, crowds reappeared in front of banks all around the island. The banks’ investment advisors had for several months been proactively calling their depositors, advising them to move their savings to money market funds for higher interest, claiming that these were as safe as deposits. We later learned that these funds were used more like petty cash. The banks simply grabbed what they needed and left only bonds in own shares against what they took. By Tuesday 30 September, access to these money market accounts was denied and the crowds were growing more frustrated by the hour. All the banks were now severely bleeding. Despite our PM emphasizing that deposits were safe in accord-ance  with  the  EU  directive  that  guaranteed  protection  up  to  €20,887,  elderly women and other locals were seen on Reykjavik streets carrying home  sacks  filled  with  cash  when  emptying  their  deposit  accounts.  People  were  stocking  up  on  necessities  in  their  houses;  canned  food,  foreign  cash,  etc.  In  desperation  some  were  investing  in  luxury  goods  and real estate to protect the value of their money.  The government finally felt forced to issue a blanket guarantee on all domestic deposits. That, however, was not enough to calm the situation, as it did not cover the money market funds. Though chaos continued on Wednesday, some were already adapting and exploiting the sense of crisis.  Many,  for  example,  considered  it  offensive  when  Jóhannesson’s  budget store Bónus advertised that people should ‘Stock up at Bónus and choose Icelandic’  1   to prepare for the coming crisis. After all, his Glitnir Bank  and  his  outvasion  endeavours  had  helped  to  create  the  crisis.  In  accordance with Bretton Wood’s rule of thumb, Iceland had reserves to last  for  four  months.  Still,  the  CEOs  of  leading  petrol  companies  were  worried they would be sucked dry if people kept hoarding.  Throughout  all  this,  the  banks  were  also  kept  busy  fighting  off  the  increased  flow  of  margin  calls.  Thursday  saw  our  currency  and  stock  market in free fall while the CDS spread on the Icelandic state rose to 817  points.  Reaching  the  top  of  the  world  list,  Glitnir  and  Kaupthing  faced a CDS spread of 2,500 points and Landsbanki shot to 3,000 above Libor.  The  Glitnir  nationalization,  which  had  been  meant  to  save  us  from  economic ruin, was now proving disastrous. Its refinancing needs could exhaust the Central Bank’s foreign reserves within a year. Sarcastically, the  Economist  asked: ‘What is the Icelandic for “domino”?’ ( Economist , 2008). At home, the government apparatus was finally kicked into gear with a high-level task force appointed to prevent a systemic collapse. The crisis unit, nicknamed the Situation Room, worked around the clock to try to contain the situation. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":123,"content":"The Crash – Collapse of the Cross-border Banks 113 Throughout  the  continent,  central  banks  and  governments  were  harmonizing their response to the crisis in Iceland. The ECB and the Bank of England, for example, were providing massive liquidity to European banks,  but  despite  a  wide-ranging  emergency  plea,  Iceland  would  not  be  allowed  access  to  these  funds.  The  same  was  true  in  Washington.  Our  representatives  were  flatly  refused  as  neighbouring  governments  collectively opposed a bail-out, referring our government instead to the IMF. Being the first Western country in four decades to surrender to the IMF  was  seen  as  a  humiliation  and  a  defeat  for  the  Icelandic  postco-lonial  project  –  as  if  we  had  failed  in  our  eternal  quest  of  securing  an  independent modern Iceland. During these dark days, representatives of the IMF came to Reykjavik in an informal capacity. Instead of throwing in the towel and surrendering to the IMF, however, our representatives were heading for Moscow.  In  the  UK,  worries  over  the  poor  state  of  the  Icelandic  banks  had  been growing for some time. Since May, unsuccessful negotiations had been under way to move the Icesave deposits to Landsbanki’s Heritable Bank  and  thus  under  the  cover  of  the  UK  banking  scheme.  On  Friday  afternoon, British Finance Minister Alistair Darling called Iceland’s PM, Mr  Geir  Haarde,  voicing  concerns  that  money  was  flowing  out  of  Kaupthing’s  London  subsidiary,  Singer  &  Friedlander.  If  the  flow  continued,  the  bank  would  be  instantly  closed.  In  the  evening,  the  British Financial Supervisory Authority called demanding £400 million from Iceland to cover the Icesave accounts. The European Central Bank also placed a margin call on Landsbanki in Luxembourg, threatening to seize many of its assets. Thus, while Iceland was desperately trotting the globe shopping for money, the UK authorities and the ECB were not only refusing any funding but indeed pressing us for cash. The firm stand of the Bank of England, the ECB and the US Federal Reserve against Iceland also  made  our  Scandinavian  neighbours  hesitant  to  help  further.  The  illusion  of  a  shelter  amongst  the  family  of  Nordic  states  was  thus  also  shattered during Iceland’s crash, which was therefore not only economic but also political and indeed psychological. To stem the bleeding of the Edge and Icesave accounts, both Kaupthing and Landsbanki were franti-cally selling off assets at rock bottom prices.    The fatal weekend  Many  were  relieved  when  end  of  business  finally  arrived  on  Friday  afternoon, 3 October. The weekend was surely a welcome break but to halt the run a solution would have to be in place before reopening on ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":124,"content":"114   Iceland and the International Financial CrisisMonday morning. The banks barely coped with the withdrawals. Some branches thus had to limit customer withdrawals. Less than one-fourth of banknotes and coins previously available were left in the Central Bank when the week was finally over. Emergency supplies of fresh bank notes were  being  printed  abroad,  as  many  branches  were  out  of  the  largest  bills. They would, however, take some time to arrive in the island.  Each  of  the  three  banks  needed  at  least  €500  million  in  emergency  funding  to  survive  only  the  short-term  headwind.  Throwing  in  panic  one-and-a-half  billion  euros,  literally  the  rest  of  the  currency  reserve,  after  troubled  banks  was  never  really  an  option.  How  would  we  then  meet  the  next  loan  payday’s?  Or  indeed  pay  for  vital  imports?  Many  versions of a bank merger were discussed. In all cases, the government and even our powerful pension funds would have to back up the new entity.  One  of  the  main  hurdles,  however,  was  the  deeply  rooted  lack  of  trust  between  the  politicians  and  the  bankers.  Especially  bad  was  the  relationship  between  the  chairman  of  the  board  of  governors  of  the Central Bank, Mr Davíð Oddsson, and some of the leading Viking Capitalists.  There  was  also  a  lack  of  trust  between  the  rival  groups  of  bankers and indeed between Oddsson and the SDA side of the govern-ment.  The  Minister  of  Commerce,  who  was  responsible  for  banking,  was, for example, never on speaking terms with Oddsson and his team in  the  Central  Bank  –  in  fact,  they  despised  each  other  so  deeply  that  they made sure never to be present in the same room. Reportedly, meet-ings were conducted like poker games.  However, in hectic discussions between the government, the Central Bank  and  surveillance  authorities,  the  bankers’  a  plan  was  gradually  emerging. To weather the storm, the Central Bank would need to secure a  large  buffer,  up  to  €10  billion  in  total,  it  was  estimated.  This  was  to  come from the sale of the foreign assets of Iceland’s powerful pension funds abroad and, most vitally, government borrowing on foreign emer-gency loans. If these solutions came up short, Iceland would be forced to split at least two of the three banks into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ banks. In that case, the main idea was to take the banks into administration but immediately  establish  new  domestic  banks  for  each  of  them  where  to  local loans and deposits would be moved. During this weekend before the  storm,  the  government  still  hoped  that  at  least  one  of  the  banks  could be saved by a €500 million loan from the Central Bank. But who would win the lottery was still being deliberated.  By the weekend, the world’s attention was turning to Iceland’s misfor-tune,  many  of  the  leading  international  media  were  flocking  over  to  report on this economic disaster area. Iceland was reported as being on ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":125,"content":"The Crash – Collapse of the Cross-border Banks 115the brink of an economic Armageddon or the equivalent of the last days of Rome. Under a headline stating that the party was now over for an island that had tried to buy the world, Tracy McVeigh (2008) of the UK  Observer  wrote: ‘The bars and restaurants of Iceland’s capital are packed, the Range Rovers and BMWs are parked nose to tail all along the streets of  the  central  101  district,  and  music  is  pumping  from  a  black  stretch  Hummer  limousine  cruising  by’.  Others  described  Reykjavik’s  atmos-phere this weekend as like the day before an atomic winter.  With  the  rapidly  increasing  flow  of  negative  reporting  abroad,  the  run on Icesave in the UK grew stronger. On Saturday, depositors could no  longer  access  their  accounts  online.  On  the  website  an  explana-tory  note  read  that  this  was  because  of  technical  problems.  Really,  however,  it  was  because  the  bank  was  already  exhausted  by  the  run;  it  could  no  longer  honour  the  withdrawals.  Out  of  the  £4.7  billion  the  300,000  or  so  depositors  held,  more  than  £300  million  ran  off  the  accounts  on  that  day  alone.  Foreign  reporters  and  government  authorities  responded  by  asking  our  government  if  it  would  provide  the same protection to foreign depositors as it had already announced for  domestic  ones.  Pressure  rose  when  the  government  struggled  to  find a diplomatic answer.  The  PM’s  residence  by  the  central  Reykjavik  pond,  in  a  peaceful  wooden  building  wrapped  in  traditional  corrugated  iron,  was  by  now  Iceland’s crisis centre. Under the watchful eye of foreign reporters and almost  all  the  country’s  news  teams,  government  ministers,  bankers,  Central Bank staff and all sorts of advisors were seen rushing about in an ever-increasing haze of panic. Though jumping for everyone in the proximity, the media could not find anyone who was able to provide the public  with  any  coherent  overview  of  the  situation.  Anticipation  was  building as news spread that the announcement of a far-reaching rescue package was due in the afternoon.  In the early evening, PM Geir Haarde spoke in secrecy with his British counterpart,  Gordon  Brown.  They  were  old  acquaintances,  since  both  had served for years as finance ministers, meeting on several occasions. The message was, however, still the same as before: no bail-out money would  be  available  internationally  for  Iceland  except  through  an  IMF  programme.  Brown  repeated  Alistair  Darling’s  concerns  from  before,  that  Kaupthing  would  unlawfully  bring  over  to  Reykjavik  one-and-a-half  billion  pounds  from  the  UK,  which  would  not  be  tolerated.  The  UK  was  in  this  regard  already  burned  by  Lehman,  which  prior  to  its  default had sneaked back to the US eight billion dollars from the City of London, and would not allow the same thing to happen again. The call ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":126,"content":"116   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisended without a solution, with Brown all but begging Haarde to call in the IMF rescue team.  Outside  the  PM’s  residence  a  pounding  rainstorm  was  punishing  all  spectators. Tension grew again when the hours passed without any clues as  to  what  the  rescue  package,  which  reportedly  was  being  negotiated  behind the closed doors, would entail. The people were thus still impa-tiently waiting for news on the fate of their country. What we did not know  was  that  all  attempts  to  shift  the  Icesave  accounts  into  British  banking space had already failed. Negotiations with the British Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) to allow Landsbanki to move the deposits to  its  London  Heritable  Bank  and  thus  under  the  UK  banking  regime  were  stuck.  The  British  were  asking  for  more  money  alongside  it  than  either Landsbanki or indeed the Icelandic state could possibly raise.  Finally, just before midnight on Sunday, our PM, Geir Haarde, stepped out of the door the news cameras had all been focused on. To the aston-ishment of most of those who were nervously waiting at home in front of their TV sets and computer screens, he told reporters that the result of  the  work  over  this  dramatic  weekend  was  that  there  was  in  fact  no  need  for  a  special  rescue  package.  He  then  quietly  excused  himself,  mentioning  in  passing  he  had  hardly  had  any  breakfast  yet  –  he  was  only stepping out to get a bite to eat after a long working day. At home, the population was left in complete dismay. The following day, Haarde’s statement proved to be a blatant lie, which many have never been able to  forgive  him  for.  But  what  could  he  say?  What  indeed  would  have  happened  if  the  PM  had  honestly  explained  that  our  financial  system  was already collapsing and about to fall on our heads? His words have since been considered the last decade’s anti-climax.    Implementing the master plan  In the small hours of Monday 6 October, the last desperate attempt to move  Icesave  to  the  UK  ended  with  a  flat  refusal  in  Westminister  and  Plan B, which had been in preparation for a few days, was kicked into action. One of the banks would get Central Bank backing but the others would be split between ‘bad’ international banks taken into receivership and  ‘good’  new  domestic  banks.  Specialists  from  JP  Morgan  who  had  worked  out  the  WaMu  acquisition  were  already  in  the  PM’s  residence  polishing the plan. A defensive wall was to be raised around Icelandic homes.  Unlike  in  most  other  countries,  in  these  trying  times  the  taxpayer was not to be asked to foot the bill for reckless bankers abroad. According  to  international  rules,  bondholders  and  depositors  over  the  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":127,"content":"The Crash – Collapse of the Cross-border Banks 117€20,887  threshold  would  have  equal  claims.  The  emergency  laws  that  had been in the making in the Ministry of Commerce would have to be rushed  through  Parliament,  most  importantly  moving  deposits  to  the  front of the rank of priority and push bondholders and other creditors towards the back of the queue. In the morning, when some of the staff finalizing the emergency plan were heading home just before opening hours, they are reported to have stopped at cash machines to withdraw as much as they could.  When the markets opened, the FME had stopped trading the banks’ stocks and the banks themselves froze all fund transactions. To counter the almost inevitable avalanche of withdrawals, the government issued a  blanket  protection  for  all  deposits    within   the  country.  The  UK  and  Netherlands  were  issuing  top-off  guarantees  for  deposits  above  the  €20,887 stipulated in the EU directive: up to €40,000 in Holland and, by Wednesday, up to £50,000 in the UK. Many European states were also issuing complete guarantees, including Ireland, Germany, Denmark and Austria. Iceland was, however, only guaranteeing  domestic  deposits but could not explicitly state what would happen in foreign branches, apart from  a  vague  general  pledge  to  the  effect  that  the  banks’  Depositors  and  Investors  Guarantee  Fund  would  be  ‘supported’.  This  would,  however, always be difficult, as deposits in foreign branches of Icelandic banks,  most  of  which  were  on  Icesave  accounts,  amounted  to  around  £8.5 billion, about 80 per cent of the country’s GDP, whereas the fund held  only  about  1  per  cent  of  that  total  amount,  which  was  compa-rable  to  other  countries.  The  ambiguity  of  the  statements  coming  out  of Reykjavik was thus worrying our neighbours, especially government officials in Whitehall.  Around noon on Monday, Alistair Darling called again to discuss these and  other  grave  matters  with  Finance  Minister  Árni  Mathiesen.  When  he  could  not  get  a  clear  state  guarantee  out  of  his  Icelandic  counter-part,  an  assurance  that  UK  depositors  would  be  protected,  at  least  up  to €20,887 according to the EU directive, he stated that this would be ‘extremely damaging to Iceland in the future’ and then ended the call saying,  ‘the  reputation  of  your  country  is  going  to  be  terrible’  (Samtal  Árna og Darlings, 2008). Mathiesen could not but agree, but he under-stood  from  their  conversation  that  he  would  still  have  some  time  to  work things out.  Kaupthing won the lottery of which bank to save. It was the biggest of  the  three,  with  the  strongest  assets  abroad.  It  would  have  the  best  chance  of  surviving.  The  Central  Bank  thus  provided  a  €500  million  short-term  loan  against  all  shares  in  Kaupthing’s  Danish  FIH  Bank  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":128,"content":"118   Iceland and the International Financial Crisissubsidiary as collateral. This came as a bitter blow to Glitnir, as the loan to  Kaupthing  was  identical  to  the  one  Glitnir  had  been  denied  just  a  week  before.  The  government  decided  to  go  even  further  and  revoked  the planned nationalization of Glitnir for €600 million. It would not be saved. The Central Bank also denied Landsbanki’s request for a similar emergency loan. Landsbanki and Glitnir were now on their own, while Kaupthing  still  had  the  Central  Bank’s  backing.  By  noon  on  Monday  it was clear that Landsbanki would be already defaulting the following day. The owners were furious at the government’s decision. This was a stark reversal of the bank’s situation of just a few months before, when it seemed to be well funded with a comfortable €800 million liquidity and strong inflow of foreign deposits. Furthermore, redemption of loans was low until late 2009. And even though it was exhausted of foreign cash by the run in the UK, the bank still had enough money in Icelandic króna  to  survive  this  storm;  the  problem  was  that  the  króna  was  no  longer tradable for foreign currency.  By  afternoon  the  króna  was  once  again  in  free  fall,  being  traded  at  different  rates  by  different  actors,  so  that  no  one  knew  its  real  value.  Icelanders abroad were having trouble withdrawing cash. For example, students  abroad,  funded  by  the  state  Student  Loan  Funding  scheme,  could not access their money to pay rent or for other necessities. Even those  abroad  who  could  get  money  with  their  cards  or  from  online  accounts  did  not  know  the  exchange  rate  they  would  get.  This  was  thus a double crisis – a banking crisis and a currency crisis – which had already started in March.    God bless Iceland  At four in the afternoon on Monday 6 October, Geir Haarde was ready to address the nation on TV. This was an extraordinary event, as apart from the  traditional  New  Year’s  Eve  address,  it  is  something  our  PM  never  does. We were all gathered in our workplaces: around radios, TV sets and computer screens. The entire nation was listening to his grave concerns: the banks were in serious trouble, he said. The state would not have the means to bail them out. If it tried, we ran a risk of being sucked with them into an economic abyss. This was a shock to most, as just hours earlier he had told reporters that all was well, that no action needed to be taken. Many were thus in disbelief when he now, in this strange address, tried to reassure Icelanders that their deposits were safe; all normal domestic banking would still be operational. He stated that if they united in these trying times, Icelanders would withstand the storm and then ended his ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":129,"content":"The Crash – Collapse of the Cross-border Banks 119unprecedented  address  by  asking  God  to  bless  Iceland  (Haarde,  2008).  This is when we knew we were in serious trouble. In a secular country this was as unusual as any of the other new experiences we were going through in these days of rapid, dramatic events.  From the TV studio the PM rushed to Parliament, where he introduced the government’s emergency legislation, which allowed the banks to be split and altered the order of payments out of the fallen banks by moving depositors  to  the  front.  This  was  a    force  majeure   situation.  The  action  was part of the defensive wall being raised around ordinary households. Foreign creditors would simply have to accept losing most of what they had  loaned  to  the  Icelandic  banks.  Before  midnight,  the  emergency  legislation  had  been  rushed  through  all  formalities  and  parliamentary  procedures. At 1:30 in the morning, government officials were sneaking past doctors and nurses to find the President of the Republic, who had been committed to Iceland’s national hospital for heart treatment. Only when  his  signature  had  been  secured  could  the  banks  be  taken  into  administration. The President was the second of the nation’s leaders to be taken ill, but not the last. SDA leader Ingibjörg Gísladóttir was still in a New York hospital recovering from severe brain surgery and later, Prime  Minister  Haarde  would  also  fall  ill,  as  I  will  discuss  in  the  next  chapter. These illnesses weakened the leadership of the country during these days of crisis.  Before  opening  of  business  on  Tuesday  morning,  a  new  board  for  Landsbanki had been appointed. The members of the new board were mostly lawyers, who had almost randomly been called in the middle of the  night.  Miraculously,  the  bank  remained  operational.  If  it  had  not  been for the media frenzy its customers might hardly have noticed that they were now banking with a new, state-owned financial institution. At the same time, in the UK, the FSA issued a moratorium on Landsbanki’s London  subsidiary,  the  Heritable  Bank.  The  world’s  media  were  now  covering  the  Icelandic  collapse  night  and  day  from  the  ever-growing  media camp in downtown Reykjavik.  With  all  funding  opportunities  closed,  the  situation  was  growing  bleaker by the hour. European rescue money was still out of reach and the  US  refused  our  Finance  Minister,  Mr  Árni  Mathiesen,  once  again  when  he  came  begging.  An  informal  delegation  of  the  IMF  had  trav-elled to Reykjavik but the government was not yet ready to enter into a formal IMF programme. Then out of the blue, as it seemed, the Central Bank’s  leading  governor,  Davíð  Oddsson,  announced  to  the  press  that  the  Russians  were  lending  us  €4  billion.  So,  unexpectedly,  Moscow  of  all places was jumping to our rescue. This broke all previous alliances, ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":130,"content":"120   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisas  Iceland  had  been  heavily  invested  in  Western  interests,  a  founding  member of NATO and host to an American army base until just two years before. Senior SDA minister Össur Skarphéðinsson said the US’s denial of help was pretty harsh given that Icelanders had for decades believed that they were in a specially friendly relationship with the US – which now in times of trouble was not amounting to much (Skarphéðinsson, 2008).  The jubilation quickly calmed, however, when we learned that Oddsson had  somewhat  misunderstood  the  Russian  ambassador  –  Moscow  was  not committing any money, only saying it was willing to consider such a plea. The money never materialized. Perhaps Moscow was only dangling its feet to the possibility of upsetting NATO’s consolidation.  If  the  Icelandic  authorities  still  enjoyed  any  credibility  abroad  after  the  misreporting  of  the  availability  of  Russian  roubles,  it  was  finally  exhausted  this  same  day  when  the  Central  Bank  announced  that  it  was  setting  a  unilateral  exchange  rate  for  the  króna,  well  above  its  current trading rate. Once again, the main governor of the Central Bank took  a  vital  economic  decision  without  consulting  the  bank’s  experts  (Jóhannesson, 2009: 160). As a result, the bank had to use a significant portion of its foreign reserves to keep an impossible peg, which there-fore held for only two days. Wade and Sigurgeirsdóttir (2012) claim that those  in  the  know  were  able  to  exploit  the  situation  and  pocket  the  spoils. Finally, some hope was again held out when Norwegian PM Jens Stoltenberg called offering help – hopefully the united front of foreign leaders was cracking. This was, however, both too little and, seemingly, too late.  In the evening, the Central Bank’s governor Davíð Oddsson appeared on  the  country’s  main  TV  news  talk  show  to  discuss  the  crisis  and  defended the Central Bank’s decisions. In simple terms he explained the Washington  Mutual  (WaMu)  method  of  splitting  the  banks  in  a  good  domestic  banks  surviving  and  bad  foreign  ones  collapsing.  Ordinary  Icelanders  would  not  be  asked  to  pay  the  foreign  liabilities  of  reckless  bankers.  Foreign  creditors  would  simply  have  to  accept  getting  only  5  to  15  per  cent  of  their  claims.  As  a  result,  however,  Iceland  would  be  cleansed  of  the  unsustainable  foreign  debt  of  private  banks  and  very  soon  ready  to  start  growing  again  (Oddsson,  2008).  This  sounded  too  good to be true – later we learned that it was. For now, however, Oddsson, once  again,  sounded  like  the  country’s  real  leader.  The  following  day,  he was proposing a new emergency government of all parties. He also proposed the formation of an ad hoc crisis committee comprising repre-sentatives  of  the  Central  Bank,  the  FME  and  the  ministries  of  finance  and  commerce,  which  in  effect  would  control  most  economic  affairs  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":131,"content":"The Crash – Collapse of the Cross-border Banks 121in  the  country.  Though  hesitant  about  a  new  emergency  government  unit, PM Haarde proposed that Oddsson, his old boss, should head the crisis committee. This was more than SDA ministers could take; many of them went berserk, claiming that Oddsson was exploiting the crisis in an attempt to steal back control over the state.  By  the  end  of  Tuesday,  Glitnir  was  exhausted.  The  planned  nation-alization had been cancelled and it was clear that the bank would not receive  the  promised  €600  million  for  75  per  cent  of  its  shares.  By  Wednesday morning, Glitnir was thus also taken into administration. Its operations in Norway and Luxembourg followed soon afterwards. Public discussion mirrored the general sense of decay. Paralysed and in panic, the public was worried about their savings in stocks, bonds and money market  funds,  much  of  which  was  gone  by  now.  The  largest  loss  was  that of Landsbanki’s owners. Its main owner, Björgólfur Guðmundsson, suffered one of the greatest individual bankruptcies in world history. His son, Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson, who had enjoyed a place amongst the richest people in the world when his name was on the Forbes 500 list, was also all but wiped out in one go. His trouble had started a bit earlier, when British travel group XL Leisure collapsed on 15 September, leaving many  holidaymakers  stranded.  For  Samson  this  was  a  potential  expo-sure of more than €200 million. All hope was, however, not yet gone for Iceland, as Kaupthing, our largest bank, was still standing.    The UK attack  With  the  Icesave  website  down,  a  run  was  also  blazing  in  the  UK  on  Kaupthing’s Edge accounts at Singer & Friedlander. Though protected by the UK’s Depositors Guarantee Scheme, the bank was still having trouble convincing customers that their deposits were safe. During these diffi-cult days, Kaupthing was being challenged on many fronts. The Finnish Financial Supervisory authority, for example, was freezing movement of its assets until the situation in Iceland had cleared.  Seen  from  the  UK  and  the  Netherlands,  the  situation  was  simply  that  Icesave  depositors  were  left  without  access  to  their  accounts.  The  website was unaccessable and no trace of the bank was left in the UK or Holland. No one answered the phone and there was not even an address to go to. Depositors were in an intolerable position – the bank had disap-peared without a trace from the face of the earth. This caused a seriously strained  relationship  Reykjavik  had  with  London  and  The  Hague.  The  British and the Dutch governments decided to compensate their deposi-tors, even beyond the €20,887 mark guaranteed by the EU directive.

The  Icesave  dispute  became  our  greatest  international  dispute  since the Cod Wars – once again with the British. During these repeated conflicts between the two islands a characteristic, postcolonial-like love–hate relationship developed.  In Whitehall, preparations had been under way for dealing with the Icelandic crisis. Icelanders would not get away with simply cutting off its  foreign  debt,  shutting  the  doors  and  leaving  British  citizens  out  in  the cold. It did not help when UK officials learned of Oddsson’s message on TV, in which he almost triumphantly stated that foreigners would be left out in the cold. The plan was to be kicked into action. The British claimed  that  giving  preference  to  depositors  in  domestic  banks  over  those in foreign branches was a breach of European regulations, which Iceland subscribed to through the EEA.  In the early morning of 8 October 2008, Alistair Darling appeared on two  of  the  UK’s  most  popular  morning  TV  programmes,  on  ITV  and  BBC,  and  claimed  that  the  Icelandic  government  was  reneging  on  its  responsibility  to  UK  depositors,  and  that  this  would  not  be  tolerated.  On the BBC he said, when referring to his conversation with Iceland’s finance  minister  Mathiesen:  ‘The  Icelandic  government,  believe  it  or  not, told me yesterday they have no intention of honouring their obli-gations here’ (Darling, 2008). In a joint press conference at 9:15 Darling and  Gordon  Brown  announced  a  massive  bail-out  of  UK-based  banks,  to the tune of £500 billion. As a result of pumping the money into the banks, the British state acquired a majority stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland and steered the merger of HBOS and Lloyds TSB, in which the state had acquired third of the shares. There was, however, not a penny for Icelandic-owned banks in the UK. On the contrary, Brown claimed that Iceland’s authorities must assume responsibility for the failed banks and announced that the UK government had taken ‘legal action against the Icelandic authorities to recover the money lost to people who depos-ited in UK branches of its banks’ (quoted in Balakrishnan, 2008).  Earlier in the morning, the UK FSA had called Kaupthing demanding £300 million instantly be moved from Reykjavik to Singer & Friedlander to meet the run on Edge accounts and then a further £2 billion over ten days. This was of course an impossible demand for Kaupthing to meet, and it instead called the Deutsche Bank, asking it to sell off Kaupthing’s operations  in  the  UK.  Deutsche’s  brokers  thought  that  could  be  done  within 24 hours.  The  legal  actions  Brown  had  mentioned  in  his  press  brief,  however,  went much further.

The action was based on the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, which had been put in place after the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September 2001. Not minding that around a hundred thousand  people  worked  for  Icelandic-held  companies  in  Britain,  the  UK  government  invoked  the  Anti-Terrorism  Act  to  freeze  the  assets  of  Landsbanki in the UK and for a while also all assets of the Icelandic state. Subsequently, Landsbanki and for a while also Iceland’s Central Bank and our Ministry of Finance was listed on the Treasuries home page along-side other sanctioned terrorist regimes, including Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, Burma, Zimbabwe and North Korea. This was in stark contrast with the response elsewhere. Authorities in the Netherlands, for example, saw no reason to freeze assets and in Stockholm the Swedish Central Bank was still trading with Kaupthing’s Swedish branch.  While  Kaupthing’s  CEO,  Einarsson,  was  in  his  London  office  in  the late morning discussing with Deutsche Bank over the phone the fastest  way  to  liquidate  its  assets,  he  read  a  banner  running  on  the  TV  screen  saying  that  the  FSA  had  already  moved  Kaupthing’s  Edge  accounts  to  ING  Direct  in  the  Netherlands.  Their  phone  conversa-tion  quickly  ended,  as  there  was  no  longer  anything  to  talk  about.  In  the  afternoon,  the  UK  authorities  issued  a  moratorium  on  Singer  &  Friedlander,  showed  its  Icelandic  CEO,  Ármann  Þorvaldsson,  the  door and sealed the offices. This instantly prompted a flow of margin calls  and  a  further  run  on  the  mother  company.  When  the  dark  set  in, Kaupthing Bank was itself taken into administration in Reykjavik. Thirty thousand shareholders lost all its worth. As had happened to the  holding  companies  Samson  and  Stoðir  when  Landsbanki  and  Glitnir  fell,  the  Exista  holding  company  was  instantly  ruined  with  the collapse of Kaupthing. The Icelandic economic miracle was over. Interestingly, the British FSA later found out that no money had ille-gally  been  moved  from  Singer  &  Friedlander  to  Iceland  (Júlíusson,  2009),  which,  however,  had  been  one  of  the  main  justifications  for  the UK’s attack on Iceland.  These  actions  were  a  co-ordinated  attack.  Indeed,  it  was  a  bomb,  which  was  to  blow  up  the  defensive  wall  that  the  Icelandic  govern-ment  was  trying  to  build  around  domestic  households.  Access  to  the  estimated  7  billion  pounds  the  Icelandic  government  and  banks  held  in assets in the UK no longer being available, the wall came tumbling down.  Invoking  Anti-Terrorist  legislation  against  a  neighbouring  state  and  fellow  NATO  and  EEA  member  was  virtually  an  act  of  war.

Moody’s instantly down-graded Iceland by three full points, to A1. Money transactions to Iceland were stopped not only in the UK but as a result also widely in Europe, where many banks refused to trade with Iceland after it had been listed in the UK with terrorist actors.  The payment and clearing system for foreign goods collapsed. In only two days, all trading in króna had ceased outside Iceland’s borders. When PM  Haarde  called  to  complain  about  this  brutal  treatment,  Brown  did  not even answer. Later in the day, Brown told Sky News that Iceland, as a state, was bankrupt. We were being completely rebuffed. In fact, in the coming days Brown’s rhetoric against Iceland was only to harden, and he said that further measures would be taken to recover money (quoted in Brown Condemns, 2008).  With  UK  depositors  holding  a  stake  of  £700  million  in  Icesave,  including  many  charities’  funding,  Brown  stated  that  the  Icelandic  authorities were now responsible for the deposits. Even in the UK, many were  stunned  by  Brown’s  harsh  response  to  the  Icelandic  crisis.  Many  claimed that by attacking Iceland, a foreign actor, Brown was attempting to divert attention from difficulties at home, perhaps much as Margaret Thatcher had done during the Falklands crisis (Murphy, 2008b). Initially it did indeed work. On its front page the  Daily Mail  declared ‘Cold War’ (2008) on Iceland and the  Daily Telegraph  screamed across its front page: ‘Give  us  our  money  back’  (2008).  And  these  were  papers  that  did  not  even support Brown or his Labour Party.  Perhaps part of the reason for this harsh response can be found in the fact that Iceland’s economic fragility turned the mirror on the UK and its  own  volatile  financial  situation.  Economist  Willem  Buiter  (2008),  who  had  studied  the  state  of  the  economy  in  both  countries,  saw  the  similarity  and  wrote  that  it  was  no  great  exaggeration  to  also  describe  the UK as a huge hedge fund.    Financial devastation  By Thursday 9 October 2008, almost the entire Icelandic financial system had collapsed in a dramatic chain of events, which later became known simply  as  The  Crash.  Ironically,  this  was  a  full  week  before  Glitnir’s  15 October deadline – which had started the whole thing. Only weeks before, all the three banks had passed the FME’s stress test with flying colours.  Landsbanki,  Glitnir  and  Kaupthing  were  all  private  firms.  Still  they  fell  on  the  state  and  indeed  on  the  general  public.  In  the  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":135,"content":"The Crash – Collapse of the Cross-border Banks 125coming  days  and  weeks,  many  smaller  savings  and  loan  companies,  investment banks and holding companies fell as well. Most businesses suffered severally, as around 70 per cent of corporate loans were foreign exchange-indexed.  The  vast  majority  of  investment  companies  suffo-cated as a result and indeed most businesses in the country were techni-cally bankrupt when the currency tanked.  Though  panic  was  perhaps  not  visible  on  the  streets,  many  were  worried  for  their  economic  survival  in  the  short  term,  let  alone  what  their financial state would be on the other side of the immediate crisis. Many  were  thus  stocking  up  on  necessities  and  shortages  were  felt  in  stores,  though  nothing  close  to  what  the  most  pessimistic  had  been  predicting  or  what  could  be  read  in  some  of  the  international  media.  Many long-lasting trading relationships were strained. Icelandic shops, for  example,  were  often  refused  imports  unless  they  paid  up  front,  which  they  were  not  accustomed  to  doing.  Iceland  was  being  isolated  on many fronts simultaneously. As the external payment system broke down,  many  transactions  were  stuck  abroad  and  some  amounting  to  significant  sums  were  even  lost.  On  international  markets,  all  things  Icelandic had become toxic. Icelanders abroad who were relying on the collapsed  króna  instantly  lost  more  than  half  their  income  and  many  were  having  serious  trouble  meeting  their  obligations  regarding  rent,  loans and bills.  Before  The  Crash,  the  banks  had  held  assets  worth  €150  billion,  almost  double  the  value  of  WorldCom  before  its  collapse  in  2002  and  around  three  times  that  of  Enron  before  its  failure  (Benediktsdóttir  et  al.,  2011).  On  Moody’s  list  of  the  largest  bankruptcies,  the  collapse  of each of the Icelandic banks was ranked 11th in world history; collec-tively,  their  demise  was  ranked  third,  after  Lehman  and  Washington  Mutual.   The   total   loss   by   creditors   was   thought   to   be   around   €47  billion  –  outstanding  loans  by  German  banks  alone  amounted  to  €15  billion.  A  higher  recovery  rate  out  of  the  fallen  banks  than  was  initially expected has, however, since significantly diminished the loss.  Initially, this seemed to be the mother of all financial crises. With the collapse  of  the  banks  more  than  three-quarters  of  the  stock  exchange  was  wiped  out.  At  its  lowest  level  the  stock  market  was  only  5  per  cent of its July 2007 high. The currency market froze and the external payment system seized. In free fall domestically, the króna became virtu-ally worthless abroad. By the end of 2008, it had fallen by 80 per cent and property prices by 25 per cent. Investment instantly fell as well as imports  and  lending.  Real  wages  fell  and  unemployment  rose.  Out  of  all the OECD countries Iceland suffered the third-biggest fall in output ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":136,"content":"126   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisduring  this  financial  crisis  and  the  fourth-biggest  fall  in  employment  (Wade & Sigurgeirsdottir, 2012).  While many of the banks’ assets proved dubious at best, their liabili-ties were very real. The Icesave liabilities alone amounted to €8.5 billion. The number of depositors in the UK was almost equal to Iceland’s popu-lation. The UK authorities were thus in effect asking every man, woman and child in Iceland to foot the cost of an Icesave account of their own. Not only had the banks left them a gigantic bill to pay, but their demise had also blown a hole in the state’s coffers, as their tax revenues, which had  amounted  to  quarter  of  the  state’s  budget,  had  disappeared  over-night. People also felt the economic turmoil privately. The widespread financialization  of  society  had  turned  many  ordinary  people  into  risk  investors. Many had grown fantastically rich through ‘amateur’ invest-ments. Now, all of a sudden, this counted equity was wiped out as well.  Only  after  the  collapse  did  Icelanders  learn  of  the  many  dubious  dealings  the  banks  had  engaged  in.  Their  owners  seemed  to  have  had  almost unrestricted access to borrowing in their respective banks. Right up until the end, they had been borrowing massive amounts from the banks’  money  market  funds,  which  staff  had  vigorously  been  pushing  onto customers in order to keep their owners afloat. The banks’ holding companies  would  simply  leave  securities  in  their  own  shares  and  take  the cash. While it became clear that these funds would lose up to a third of  their  value,  many  were  angry  when  learning  of  this  money  market  manipulation.  The owners of the banks had also freely been exploiting the limited liability of companies when establishing new businesses, which would borrow from their bank and use the money to fund something entirely different. These new, heavily indebted companies were then left without any  assets,  which  quite  often,  we  learned  after  the  Crash,  had  been  moved to Luxemburg or to tax havens in the Caribbean, mainly to the British Virgin Islands – where Tortola for some reason became a popular destination  for  cash  out  of  Iceland,  hosting  130  Icelandic  companies.  This is just one example of how the banks and holding companies were looted  from  within.  Many  ruses  were  used  to  suck  money  out  of  the  banks, for example through excessive salaries and bonus payments and ridiculous expenses.  We were all stunned when learning of the scale of the debt left behind. Jón  Ásgeir  Jóhannesson  and  his  companies  alone  owed  more  than  a  thousand billion ISK, between 70 and 80 per cent of the country’s GDP. He  had  started  his  career  as  a  small  grocery  store  owner,  undercutting  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":137,"content":"The Crash – Collapse of the Cross-border Banks 127the slow moving established conglomerate and offering better prices by stripping off fat and bringing down overhead costs. Leading up to The Crash he had, however, himself become the conglomerate, on steroids, with little control over his empire.  Our authorities were also at fault. The groups of Viking Capitalists were allowed  to  merge  investment  banking  with  commercial  banking  and  exploit the implicit government guarantee for both operations. Through the domestic trade of love letters alone the banks were able to generate liquidity amounting to 13 per cent of GDP. As a result, the Central Bank was technically bankrupted by The Crash, when it lost what amounted to quarter of the country’s GDP. The state had to step in and bail out its own Central Bank with an injection of 270 billion króna.  Evidently,  in  the  days  and  weeks  before  The  Crash,  the  banks  had  loaned  massive  amounts,  literally  their  last  liquidity,  to  their  owners.  When this came to light, we learned that in the days leading up to The Crash  Kaupthing’s  management  had  in  a  London  meeting  decided  to  free  key  staff  from  being  responsible  for  personal  loans  they  took  out  in  the  bank  to  buy  Kaupthing  shears.  On  realizing  all  this,  the  people  in  Iceland  became  angry.  The  Viking  Capitalists  were  no  longer  their  heroes but had rapidly become the villains in this horrific saga. Many of them could be seen fleeing on their private jets from Reykjavik airport ‘like  the  last  helicopter  out  of  Saigon’,  as  one  foreign  reporter  put  it  (Jackson, 2008).  Immediately after The Crash, Reykjavik was almost invaded by foreign vultures manoeuvring among the ruins to acquire assets on the cheap. Amongst  them  was  UK  shopping  mogul  Philip  Green,  Jóhannesson’s  old business partner, who was attempting to snatch up Baugur’s assets for  only  5  per  cent  of  its  debt.  Though  Green  was  not  successful,  lots  of  valuable  assets  were  squandered  in  this  way.  When  forced  to  sell,  Glitnir’s branch in Norway was practically stolen for only a fraction of its worth. This happened when the Norwegian Depositors Guarantee Fund issued  a  margin  call  on  Glitnir  without  any  warning.  Only  few  years  earlier, the bank had been bought for 3.1 billion Norwegian krona. Now it  was  taken  for  only  300  million.  Later  we  learned  that  the  chairman  of the Norwegian Depositors Fund, Finn Haugan, was also leading the banks heading the takeover. Soon the asset was almost up to its previous worth,  turning  a  massive  profit  for  those  who  had  plotted  the  hostile  acquisition.  Another  group  of  travellers  visiting  us  in  these  days  were  lawyers representing creditors. In the week right before The Crash, most Reykjavik hotels were filled with lawyers and other crisis travellers.

Its reputation had also been destroyed. The rhetoric in the world’s  media  was  aggressive.    The  Australian ,  for  example,  suggested  that  alongside  the  US  Iceland  was  the  most  ‘immoral  country  in  the  world’ (Devine, 2008). Making no distinction between the actions of the different actors, the media lumped Icelandic bankers, politicians and the public together in a claim that  Iceland  as a whole had failed (for more, see Chartier, 2011).  Le Monde , for example, reported that Iceland in its entirety was bankrupt (Mamou, 2008). The fear was that others would soon  follow,  most  pressingly  the  Baltics,  which  were  tilting  towards  a  financial cliff of their own.  Appetites   for   disaster   stories   out   of   Iceland   seemed   insatiable.   Ironically, in the evening of the day Landsbanki fell, the CEO of adver-tising agency Indentica in the UK, Franco Bonadia, accepted an award for  ‘best  marketing  campaign’  for  the  Icesave  deposits  advertisements.  Bonadia later described how strange it felt that his successful campaign had  become  a  running  gag  at  the  London  gala  award  ceremony  (Montgomery,  2008).  In  Copenhagen,  a  journalist  from  the  Danish  tabloid  Ekstrabladet  started a collection for poor Iceland outside Magasin du Nord, one of the main landmarks of the Icelandic Viking Capitalists in Copenhagen. On the eBay website, Iceland was listed for auction with a starting price of 99 cents and the mock listing was reported by news media around the world. Iceland’s fall from grace was emphasized in the UN Security Council election, in which we lost to Austria and Turkey by a much greater margin than expected.  During  these  dramatic  days,  many  reports  told  stories  of  Icelanders  being verbally abused by strangers on the street in some of our neigh-bouring capitals, of people being laid off or having their rent cancelled just for being Icelandic. In Copenhagen, a young Icelandic mother was refused service in a central H&M store, and a customs official at Stansted airport  in  London  reportedly  asked  Icelanders  passing  through  if  they  worked in a bank; if they said ‘yes’, they were not allowed to transit (for more, see Jóhannesson, 2009).

In the boom years, Reykjavik had undergone a transformation, with  many  new  high-rise  buildings  and  luxury  neighbourhoods  built  from scratch. The titanic Harpa concert hall under construction by the old  harbour,  which  was  to  cost  almost  1.5  per  cent  of  the  country’s  GDP,  was  viewed  as  symbolic  of  the  megalomaniac  boom  years.  One  of  the  new  villa  neighbourhoods  on  Reykjavik’s  eastern  outskirts  had  newly laid, illuminated roads but no finished houses. These unfinished constructions became the icons of a crisis-ridden Iceland when foreign news  people  delivered  their  reports  standing  in  front  of  what  looked  like ruins.  In    Vanity  Fair   Michael  Lewis  reported  on  the  ‘single  greatest  act  of  madness  in  financial  history’  (Lewis,  2009),  claiming  that  the  state  owed a thousand billion dollars in banking losses, each individual, man, woman and child thus being owed roughly $330,000. He wrote that in a  ‘stunning  collective  madness’  Iceland  had  re-invented  itself  around  2003 from a tiny fishing island to a global financial power. On a more upbeat note, he wrote that after the collapse, the women had given up on the men, who had ruined Iceland, and taken control of the country.  In  the  more  serious  press,  our  leaders  were  ranked  amongst  those  blamed for the larger international financial crisis. The  Guardian  listed Geir Haarde among the 25 world leaders responsible for the crisis (Finch, 2009),  Time Magazine  did likewise, naming Davíð Oddsson as one of the main  villains  (25  People  to  Blame  for  the  Financial  Crisis,  2009)  and  the  Huffington Post  listed Finance Minister Árni Mathiesen as one of the world’s worst bankers (Graham, 2008).    Conclusion  Iceland’s  Viking  finance-dominated  economy  was  the  first  casualty  of  the  international  financial  crisis  when  its  three  big  banks,  Glitnir,  Landsbanki and Kaupthing, came crashing down in October 2008. On the back of emergency legislation they were in quick succession split up and partly nationalized. The króna went into free fall and inflation sky-rocketed,  rendering  both  consumer  price  indexation-based  mortgages  and  foreign  currency  loans  unsustainable,  40  per  cent  of  households  soon  went  into  significant  arrears  on  their  mortgage  repayments.  The  collapse of the currency was a test of strength in which it was impossible for the Viking historic bloc to pass.  Though differently orchestrated, Cyprus played a similar trick in 2013 when  its  overinflated  banking  system  came  to  a  grinding  halt.  After  cancelling a proposal to tax deposits to bail out the oversized banks, the ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":140,"content":"130   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisgovernment took its second largest bank, Laike Bank, into administra-tion. The Mediterranean island’s banks were filled with foreign deposits, mostly Russian. Deposits of up to €100,000 were moved to the Bank of Cyprus, with the rest partly nationalized. Shareholders and creditors lost almost all their worth, as did rich foreign depositors, who lost everything above the €100,000 mark. This was the first sign of Europe adopting an Icelandic method of dealing with troubled oversized banks.  One of the main mistakes of the Icelandic banks was accepting equity as collateral, as this created weak capital. To boost equity, key staff of the banks were pressured to invest in its stock, which the bank would loan against. Before the fall, employees of Kaupthing, for example, owned 9 per cent of its stock. Perhaps this helps to explain the loyalty of key staff and  the  lengths  they  were  willing  to  go  to  in  order  to  save  the  banks  from defaulting.  When  the  dust  had  settled,  we  saw  that  the  Central  Bank  really  did  all it could to bail out the banks; its vaults were emptied of almost the entire  reserve  and  the  Central  Bank  was  in  the  end  technically  bank-rupt. It simply did not have the means to prevent the collapse. With a reserve-to-external debt ratio of only 8 per cent the Central Bank never had a chance to back up the system.  The collapse of the Icelandic banks clearly revealed a serious weakness in the European banking passport system, a macroeconomic imbalance within the Single European Market. It was a weakness that some of the more established banking nations had warned against when the system was being constructed (for more, see Benediktsdóttir et al., 2011). The main flaw lay in the fragmented nature of supervision on an otherwise common market – European-wide regulation but only local supervision. This  had  caused  a  mismatch  between  access  to  market  and  adequate  supervision.  In Iceland, there was a further local problem to add to this European weakness.  Unlike  the  supervision  authorities  in  many  European  coun-tries, who understood their function as to holistically monitor the finan-cial system in both practical and legal terms, the Icelandic FME followed an ultra-legalistic approach, claiming that it had no authority to inter-vene to prevent the collapse and that its only function was to make sure the banks followed the letter of the law. It is evident, for example, that the British FSA was much more active than our small FME both leading up to and during The Crash.  Despite these unfavourable external factors, we can still conclude that the Icelandic growth model collapsed under its own weight. The hard-driven procyclical economic policies explained in Chapter 4 proved to ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":141,"content":"The Crash – Collapse of the Cross-border Banks 131be a recipe for disaster when crisis hit: young, inexperienced but over-ambitious  managers  drove  the  rapid  expansion  of  an  interconnected  banking system based on high gearing to equity, which was dependent on  foreign  funding.  When  explaining  what  went  wrong,  Kaupthing’s  CEO,  Sigurður  Einarsson,  noted  that  the  capitalist  system  had  been  contaminated by elements that contradicted its principles, meaning that public guarantees and state banking had compromised the morals of the banks’ management and owners (Einarsson, 2008). Be that as it may, the incredibly rapid expansion of an unsustainable financial system surely does help to explain the world’s most spectacular financial collapse.  Still,  the  Icelandic  banks  were  in  principle  perhaps  not  all  that  different from banks elsewhere during this time of international boom. What separated them from others was clearly the limited capacity of the small Central Bank to back them up. Iceland’s far too exposed banks no longer had a credible lender of last resort. The banks’ oversized liabilities were  in  foreign  currency  and  outside  the  reach  of  the  state.  For  some  reason  the  bankers,  the  government,  the  surveillance  authorities  and  the public at large ignored this systemic risk. The reason for this collec-tive ignorance can be found in Iceland’s national identity, as explained in Chapter 1.  Being in the Single European Market but outside the fence of EU insti-tutions left us without shelter when the crisis hit. The Crash not only was economically very detrimental but also dealt a blow to our national identity. The Icelandic  outvasion  was no longer a heroic conquest but an international joke.  Even  as  the  contradictions  of  Icelandic  Viking  finance-dominated  capitalism became undeniably visible, nationalistic rhetoric retained its foothold.  The  dispute  with  the  UK  and  Dutch  governments  over  the  Icesave deposits fell into familiar trenches. Though ambiguity remained as to who was legally liable for the loss, the UK government was using all means available to pressure Iceland to accept responsibility. Internally, Iceland  was  represented  as  a  victim  of  vicious  and  conspiratorial  foreigners. Even the Nordic states were viewed as ‘traitors’, especially the Swedish government, which soon became the main villain of the piece in the minds of many Icelandic parliamentarians. Surely there were some merits in this feeling as later evidence discussed in the following chapter point to an joint international action, lead by the UK, of not assisting Iceland.  During  this  horrible  week  in  October  2008,  Iceland  not  only  was frozen out of international markets but also suffered a co-ordinated attack  from  abroad.

When  Iceland  was  vindicated  of  any  wrongdoing  in  the  Icesave affair by the EFTA court in 2013, many saw the feeling of victimi-zation as justified, as is further discussed in the following chapter.  Within Iceland, many were also angry at the seeming incompetence of  our  government  to  meet  the  crisis.  The  passivity  of  the  authorities  leading up to The Crash is indeed noteworthy. The seeming inaction of Prime Minister Geir Haarde became notorious, resulting in a common term named after him: ‘To do a Haarde’  2   – meaning to do nothing. In his defence, Haarde maintains that the banks lied to him, for example claiming to have access to enough liquidity to keep going until the end of 2009.

Mixing a libertarian ideology of privatiza-tion and market liberalization with weak public institutions and cronyist processes had proven to be a recipe for disaster. The public was in state of shock, uncertain of its economic future. This was not only a financial crisis but also a crisis of politics and a fundamental blow to our national identity, which was in tatters. Instantly, the public took to the streets, protesting  against  the  government’s  seeming  incompetence  in  dealing  with  the  crisis.  Already  in  March,  however,  truck  drivers  had  started  a  smaller and more segmented protest against rising petrol prices accom-panying  the  sharp  devaluation  of  the  króna,  which  was  devastating  their  highly  leveraged  business  –  many  could  no  longer  meet  rising  loan  repayments.  Now,  in  the  wake  of  The  Crash,  the  general  public  was taking to the streets, banging on pots and pans and other kitchen utensils. The government’s apparent weakness in responding to the UK attack, described in the previous chapter, added to the public’s frustra-tion, especially when it had become clear that no money had illegally been moved out of the UK.  In order to prevent the economy from grinding to a halt, with devas-tating  effects,  Iceland  was  in  desperate  need  of  foreign  funding.

Our government, however, was still afraid of the stigma of being the first Western state in four decades to surrender to  the  IMF.  In  late  October,  Iceland  finally  caved  in  to  the  collective  pressure and sought help from the fund. To our surprise, the IMF board refused  help  unless,  we  were  made  to  understand,  we  first  cleared  up  the Icesave dispute with the British and the Dutch. Holding out for less than  a  month  longer,  the  government  threw  in  the  towel  and  under  impossible pressure accepted to guarantee deposits up to the minimum €20,887 stipulated by EU law.  The  forced  Icesave  agreement  angered  the  public,  which  took  to  the  streets  in  ever  greater  numbers.  Caving  in  to  foreign  pressure  and  accepting  a  forced  agreement  was  seen  as  violating  the  Icelandic  Project,  the  eternal  and  sacred  quest  of  protecting  Iceland’s  sover-eignty. After a series of protests, which later became known as the Pots and  Pans  Revolution  (  búsáhaldabyltinging ),  the  grand  coalition  of  the  Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance was ousted from power in late January 2009, paving the way for a new left-wing govern-ment – the first purely left-wing coalition in the history of the republic. This chapter discusses the unprecedented events leading up to the Pots and Pans Revolution and further analyses the nationalistic rhetoric poli-ticians used in the blame game that immediately emerged in the wake of the Crash and rose to a new high in the Icesave-dispute with the UK and the Netherlands.    Taking to the streets  On the basis of emergency laws rushed through Parliament the previous day,  Landsbanki  was  taken  into  administration  in  the  early  morning  of  Tuesday  7  October  2008.  Glitnir  fell  on  Wednesday  and  Kaupthing  before  dawn  on  Thursday.  Capital  controls  were  introduced  and  the  economy  seemed  paralysed.  The  severity  of  the  currency  crisis  which  followed the banking collapse can for example be seen in the fact that Iceland  was  the  only  country  that  had  to  revert  such  extreme  meas-ures  as  implementing  capital  controls.  On  Friday  10  October,  the  first  of many popular protests started. After only a few hours’ promotion via Facebook, around 300 protesters gathered in front the Central Bank in Reykjavik demanding that its leading governor, Mr Davíð Oddsson – our long-standing previous Prime Minister and leader of the IP – step down.

However,  Iceland’s economy had, though, for months been on a downward spiral. As early as March, a bunch of truck drivers had initiated a public protest against  rising  petrol  prizes  when  the  currency  sharply  devalued  by  a  quarter.  It  is  telling  of  the  extreme  financialization  of  the  society  and  general  lack  of  fiscal  caution  even  amongst  the  ordinary  public  that  many  truck  drivers  had  leveraged  their  assets  to  the  top,  leaving  very  little margin to maneuverer when payments suddenly rose. Many had taken out foreign currency loans to finance their trucks and other equip-ment  for  their  businesses.  When  the  currency  fell  and  prices  started  rising,  many  suddenly  found  themselves  on  the  wrong  side  of  their  balance sheet as monthly payments exceeded income.  Artists played a prominent role in structuring the protests in the wake of The Crash. A couple of classical musicians, for example, initiated the first protest in front of the Central Bank. A well known folk song singer and stage actor – a veteran campaigner for gay rights – followed suit and started  a  series  of  regular  protests  in  front  of  Parliament  on  Saturday  afternoons.  Social  media  became  the  main  instrument  for  promoting  these events. Initially, this was a diffuse bunch of protesters with a variety of demands gathering in small groups around the country, in front of banks and government buildings. The protesters often used rhythm to create an underlying beat for their messages. Soon, however, the regular Saturday protests became the focal point for protesters. On the grass in front  of  Parliament  a  stage  was  built  for  writers,  academics  and  other  intellectuals to deliver dramatic speeches to the protesting public.  Though  the  protesters  held  different  and  often  contradictory  views,  three  collective  demands  soon  emerged:  first,  for  the  government  to  resign  and  hold  an  election;  second,  for  the  heads  of  the  Central  Bank and the financial supervisory authority to be sacked; and third – a  more  long-term  goal  –  to  resurrect  Iceland  on  a  reformed  platform,  for example, by writing a new constitution (for more, see Jóhannesson, 2009; and Sveinsson, 2013).    Adding insult to injury: the Icesave dispute and the IMF  The  dispute  with  the  British  and  Dutch  governments  over  the  Icesave  accounts added to public frustration.

While  SDA  ministers  were  advocating applying to the IMF, the IP leadership still believed that the fund was only for bankrupt and in effect failed states, which Iceland was not. Most significantly, entering into an IMF programme was viewed as surrendering our sovereignty, which is never an option in Icelandic poli-tics in view of the previously described postcolonial national identity.  However, after the collapse of the banks, the IMF gradually emerged as the only solution to our immediate problems, as Iceland was still being isolated internationally. The British and Dutch governments had been successfully lobbying both the ECB and other European states not to aid Iceland  independently,  while  at  the  same  time  pressuring  our  govern-ment to accept responsibility for the Icesave deposits. Our government, on the contrary, insisted that according to the relevant EU directive it was only obligated to ensure that a Depositors Guarantee Fund was in place and not explicitly responsible for foreign branch deposits (Blöndal &  Stefánsson,  2008).  The  problem  was  that,  as  in  most  EU  countries,  the  fund  held  only  around  1  per  cent  of  the  liabilities  of  the  banking  system.  Referring  to  a  report  written  for  the  French  Central  Bank  in  2000,  Iceland  argued  that  the  directive  did  not  explicitly  dictate  that  the state had to pick up the balance in the event of a systemic collapse (Banque de France, 2000).  This  was,  however,  a  difficult  argument  to  get  through  in  the  crisis-ridden  climate  at  the  time.  In  order  to  prevent  a  further  run  on  their  own  banks  and  to  regain  enough  credibility  to  keep  them  afloat,  the  British,  during  these  same  days,  led  a  coalition  of  G20  and  EU  states  promoting  collective  international  action  emphasizing  almost  blanket  depositors  protection  (see,  for  example,  Pilkington,  2008).  Allowing  Iceland to leave depositors in foreign branches without such protection was seen as countering these efforts and indeed undermining the entire global  financial  system.  In  Whitehall,  many  feared  that  the  Icelandic  crisis was spreading to the UK, which also had approached the brink of widespread banking collapse. As a result, Iceland was being turned into an international villain. We felt trapped. Only our closest neighbour, the tiny Faroe Islands, was willing to swim against the current and sent over €45 million without any conditions. This was a lone friendly voice in a time when the international community was collectively condemning us. Even today, Icelanders are extremely grateful for the friendly gesture of our tiny neighbour. It thus called for a celebration when we were able to pay the loan back in early 2013.  Though  Iceland  was  still  stubbornly  hesitating,  a  joint  economic  programme   was   informally   being   negotiated   that   would   include   ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":148,"content":"The Pots and Pans Revolution – and Defiance Abroad 139$2.1  billion  from  the  IMF  and  a  further  $3  billion  from  the  Central  Banks of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden in addition to a sepa-rate loan from Poland. Our resilience was diminishing by the day. The pressure to accept responsibility for the Icesave deposits grew. According to some reports, Iceland was even threatened with being expelled from the European Economic Area (EEA), our economic lifeline to the outside world  (Hálfdanardóttir,  2008).  With  dwindling  foreign  reserves  and  at risk of a serious shortage of, for example, medicine, food and other necessities from abroad, Iceland finally threw in the towel and applied to enter the IMF emergency programme on 25 October.  Based on informal query our government expected that the IMF board would accept our application on 3 November (Sveinsson, 2013: 46). In the  meantime,  however,  the  British  and  Dutch  governments,  which  previously had been pressuring us to go to the IMF, were now lobbying behind the scenes  against  us being allowed into the programme unless we first accepted responsibility for the Icesave accounts (Duncan, 2008). The  NRC Handelsblad  in the Netherlands reported that the blockage was being orchestrated by Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos and his British colleague Alistair Darling (Banning & Gerritsen, 2008). Later, the chief IMF representative in Iceland admitted to a block by not only the British and Dutch governments but also the Nordic states (Rozwadowski, 2013). When Iceland would not concede, the IMF board postponed its decision on our application. We were made to clearly understand that our plea would  be  blocked  until  our  acceptance  of  liability  for  Icesave.  During  this  time,  a  senior  advisor  in  the  IMF’s  external  relations  department  publicly  acknowledged  that  the  delay  was  directly  due  to  unresolved  disputes with Holland and the UK (Transcript of Press Briefing by David Hawley,  2008).  As  Iceland  was  not  a  member  of  the  EU  and  thus  not  subject to the European Court of Justice, and as the EFTA Court had no jurisdiction in the UK and the Netherlands, there seemed at the time to be no available legal body to rule on the dispute.  Iceland  was  thus  caught  in  a  tight  spot.  We  needed  money  to  prevent  further  deterioration  of  our  already  devastated  economy  but  that  meant  agreeing  to  liabilities  we  did  not  want  to  accept.  Though  Norway finally broke away from the unified bloc within the IMF and agreed to send over €500 million, as later did Poland, which unilater-ally pledged $200 million, companies and households in Iceland were feeling the effects of the prolonged lack of access to currency. Holding out  for  only  a  couple  of  weeks  longer,  we  finally  surrendered  on  16  November.  According  to  the  revoked  11  October  agreement,  which  Finance  Minister  Mathiesen  had  been  forced  to  sign,  Iceland  was  to  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":149,"content":"140   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisrepay the Icesave dept over ten years, starting three years after signing, with 6.7 per cent interest on the loan. With the new guidelines agreed between  the  disputing  parties,  brokered  by  the  French  EU  Presidency  the  government  of  Iceland  agreed  to  cover  the  deposits  of  depositors  in  the  Icesave  accounts  in  accordance  with  EEA  law.  These  so-called  ‘Brussels Guidelines’ also entailed that the EU would continue to partic-ipate  in  finding  arrangements  that  would  allow  Iceland  to  restore  its  financial  system  and  economy.  A  stabilization  package  of  financial  assistance from the IMF was an explicit part of the agreement, which was to be discussed at the IMF Executive Board meeting on Wednesday 19 November (Agreed Guidelines, 2008).  Three  days  after  surrendering,  Iceland  was  thus  the  first  developed  economy  to  enter  an  IMF  emergency  programme  since  the  UK  in  1976 – many other states were, however, soon to follow. Though this first agreement on the Icesave deposits was meant to end the quarrel, the  dispute  was  only  just  starting.  Amibutiy  still  remained.  To  keep  up  the  pressure,  and  even  to  increase  it,  the  Dutch  Foreign  Minister,  Maxime  Werhagen,  threatened  to  veto  Iceland’s  EU  bid  in  July  2009  (The Hague Threatens Iceland, 2009). In the end, two additional agree-ments  were  proposed,  both  rejected  by  the  public  in  extraordinary  referendums  initiated  by  the  President  when  he  refused  to  sign  them  into law, as discussed later in this chapter. In January 2013, the EFTA Court finally vindicated Iceland of any wrongdoing, thus refusing the EU’s and the UK and the Dutch governments claim of a state guarantee, such as Iceland had been forced to accept in the earlier Icesave agree-ments (Judgment of the Court, 2013).    ‘God Damn, Fucking Fuck’  The seemingly imposed agreement had angered the public, and within Parliament  there  were  MPs  who  insisted  they  would  not  consider  themselves  bound  by  what  they  viewed  as  an  ‘unlawful,  coerced  agreement’  (Blöndal,  2008).  The  government  justified  the  signing  by  claiming  that  it  had  had  no  choice.  Either  we  bit  the  bullet  and  accepted responsibility or we would remain frozen out, thus without access  to  vital  imports  such  as  medicine  and  food.  The  government  explained that no one supported us; not even our Nordic neighbours were willing to listen to our legal arguments in the case. Without the agreement, Iceland would no longer have been considered a modern state, internationally recognized as equal to others, but would rather have  been  relegated  to  being  an  isolated  outpost  surviving  on  local  agriculture  and  fisheries  alone.  The  signing  was,  however,  a  serious  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":150,"content":"The Pots and Pans Revolution – and Defiance Abroad 141blow  to  our  political  identity,  as  our  postcolonial  national  identity  insisted on our not giving in to foreign pressure. It thus caused great strain  domestically.  Referring  to  the  distinctive  title  of  the  Danish  colonial governor stationed in Iceland in the old days,  landstjóri , one critic of the IMF, a well known intellectual of the IP, said that we now had  just  such  a  governor  from  Washington,  a  new    landstjóri ,  who,  much like our former Danish colonizers, would control the country’s economy (Magnússon, 2008).  Frustrated by the government’s apparently weak response to the UK attack when Iceland was listed with terrorist regimes like the Taliban and Al-Qaida,  a  group  of  Icelanders  with  ties  to  the  UK  formed  a  citizens’  movement  called  InDefence.  Under  a  campaign  titled  ‘Icelanders  are  NOT Terrorists’ the group collected more than 83,000 signatures, by far largest signature collection in our history, which was handed to the UK Parliament in protest against the UK government’s use of anti-terrorism legislation against Iceland. The group then organized a PR offensive in the UK, publishing articles and giving countless interviews in the British media.  Later,  the  InDefence  group  led  the  domestic  campaign  against  the Icesave agreements (InDefence, n.d.).  After Iceland’s concession to the British and the Dutch over Icesave, the  general  public  took  to  the  streets  in  even  greater  numbers  than  before, now not only protesting against our government’s mismanage-ment of the economy but also against apparent foreign oppression. We were  being  flooded  with  bad  news.  According  to  estimations,  the  cost  of fully protecting domestic deposits and establishing new banks out of the ruins of the failed ones would bring public debt from 29 per cent of GDP up to 109 per cent by end of 2009; before 2010 was out, we would need a further $24 billion from abroad (Jóhannesson, 2009: 258). Many compared the agreement to the Treaty of Versailles when, after the First World War, the Germans were forced to accept impossible liabilities – as Foreign Minister Gísladóttir had argued in the  New York Times  before the agreement was signed (quoted in Lyall, 2008).  Frustration  grew  as  businesses  closed  and  more  and  more  people  were  laid  off  while  inflation  rose  to  20  per  cent.  The  protest  was  now  spreading  around  the  country.  The  foreign  media  was  also  becoming  increasingly interested in the events as the crowds grew larger. Initially, only a couple of hundred protesters showed up for the weekly Saturday protests in front of the Parliament building. By November, the crowds had grown to several thousands. In January, the numbers would reach five figures.  The  country  was  in  a  state  of  shock  and  the  cracks  in  the  govern-ment  coalition  were  becoming  increasingly  apparent.

The  Central  Bank  blamed  the  bankers,  the  bankers  in turn blamed the government, and the SDA part of the government blamed the Central Bank and financial supervisory authority while the IP  leadership  attributed  all  the  blame  to  the  ‘international  financial  crisis’. Professor Gissurarson, a promoter of the failed neoliberal model, for example refused any responsibility. Furthermore, he said that capi-talism  as  such  was  not  to  blame  for  the  events  either,  but  rather  reck-less individual capitalists. ‘We must differentiate between capitalism and capitalists,’ he said (quoted in Jóhannesson, 2009).  All the while, the public was growing increasingly tired of everyone’s refusal  to  accept  responsibility.  The  signs  protesters  waved  portrayed  the  frustration  quite  well.  Amongst  the  hand-painted  slogans  were:  ‘Government go away’, ‘Stop paying’, ‘Stop the corruption’, ‘Out with Oddsson.’  The  one  that  was,  however,  believed  to  best  capture  the  protesters’ frustration simply read: ‘God Damn, Fucking Fuck’.  1    To lighten the mood during these grave times, sarcastic humour also played  a  prominent  role.  During  the  boom,  the  new  class  of  Viking  Capitalists had been keen on showing off their wealth by, for example, driving  around  Reykjavik  in  luxury  cars  like  Hummers,  Land  Cruisers  and  Range  Rovers,  which  were  imported  to  Iceland  in  large  numbers.  Now,  these  previously  prestigious  vehicles  were  being  referred  to  as  ‘Bummers’, ‘Grand Losers’ and ‘Game Overs’.  The  apparent  public  frustration  in  addition  to  the  Icesave  agree-ment  and  the  involvement  of  the  IMF,  was  challenging  the  unity  of  the government. The SDA was by now aggressively pressuring the IP to apply for EU membership, providing a fast track into the Eurozone, as a way to protect the currency from falling even further – ‘First IMF then EU’, wrote SDA party leader Gísladóttir (2008b). While the IP was still hesitating, its leaders agreed to hold an extraordinary party convention in early 2013, at which the party’s anti-EU policy would be re-examined (Sveinsson, 2013: 224).  During  this  period  of  widespread  upheaval  the  country  was  flooded  with  all  sorts  of  miracle  workers  selling  simple,  quick-fix  solutions  to  complex problems; on the currency issue, for example, we were advised to  create  a  new  one  and  leave  behind  all  debts  in  the  old  króna  or  to  unilaterally adopt several foreign currencies and thus surrender mone-tary policy to Central Banks we were not even connected. One of these miracle workers offered massive loans from Hugo Chavez in Venezuela; another  advocated  deep-pocketed  capital  injection  from  a  Hong  Kong  based investor.

Though stalemate persisted on many pressing issues, Parliament did agree to establish a Special Investigation Commission, kind of a truth committee,  which  was  to  examine  the  cause  of  The  Crash  and  would  eventually point to the legal responsibility of ministers and high-level government officials. The government also decided to appoint a Special Prosecutor, who was to investigate possible illegal actions of the banks leading up to The Crash. However, if this was meant to soothe the angry public, it did not work, as the protests were only gaining momentum.    ‘In-com-pe-tent go-vern-ment’: an all-Iceland revolution  2008  ended  with  a  bang  when  protesters  forced  themselves  into  the  traditional live TV show on New Year’s Eve where the country’s political leaders  were  in  a  celebratory  setting  discussing  the  events  of  the  year.  Protesters claimed they were in the right to invade what they believed was an ivory tower where leaders out of touch with the ordinary public were  hiding.  This  set  a  more  violent  tone  for  the  coming  January  protest – when the government was finally ousted from power.  Within  the  government  and  amongst  the  established  elite  many  initially tried to dismiss the protesters, claiming that they were mostly old acquaintances: radical lefties and young anarchists skipping school for  something  more  exciting.  This  attitude,  however,  underestimated  the  weight  of  the  undercurrent.  Alongside  the  young  anarchist  one  could  find  his  grandmother  banging  her  wooden  spoon  on  saucepans  and other kitchen utensils. The Pots and Pans Revolution was gaining momentum.  Through theatrical, musical and rhetorical means the protest developed characteristics  of  its  own  identifying  aesthetics.  To  convey  its  message  a collective mantra gradually emerged whereby, over a ritualistic drum-ming beat created by banging on anything that could deliver a sound, protesters  shouted  the  same  words  over  and  over  again:    Van-hæf-ríkis-stjórn   –  meaning  ‘in-com-pe-tent  go-vern-ment’.  This  repeated  mantra  grew into what can be viewed as a distinctive mass musical event. The protest has for this reason been defined as a specific cultural organiza-tion with structural elements (Sigurjónsson, 2011).  Anticipation  grew  and  many  expected  that  Parliament  would  face  a  greater  number  of  protesters  than  ever  when  resuming  on  20  January.  Two  weeks  earlier,  the  government  had  officially  decided  not  to  take  the  UK  government  to  a  British  court  for  freezing  Icelandic  assets  by  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":153,"content":"144   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisthe  so-called  Landsbanki  Freezing  Act,  which  was  based  on  the  UK  Anti-Terrorism legislation. This angered many even further. The action of  the  UK  government  was  seemingly  in  violation  of  several  interna-tional laws, including the European Economic Area agreement. It could therefore be argued that the British Labour government had by default also  taken  over  the  bank’s  obligation  in  the  UK  –  including  payments  from the Icesave accounts. Why the Icelandic government did not used this obvious argument to transfer the responsibility onto Brown’s own shoulders was a mystery to most people in Iceland.  Growing friction within the government was also becoming evident. SDA  minsters  wanted  Oddsson  out  of  the  Central  Bank  and  were  still  pressuring  the  IP  to  agree  to  apply  for  EU  membership.  Many  smaller  SDA  associations  around  the  country  were  now  calling  on  the  party  leadership to end the coalition and hold an early election.  Though  most  were  protesting  in  peace,  violent  outbursts  and  inci-dents grew more common in the New Year: the flags of the banks were burned;  fireworks  were  shot  at  government  buildings;  Parliament’s  historic  brick  and  stone  building  in  central  Reykjavik  was  pounded  with  eggs,  yogurt  and  tomatoes,  which  had  to  be  cleaned  every  morning;  the  homes  and  luxury  cars  of  the  Viking  Capitalists  were  vandalized – in the early morning, it was not uncommon for some of the most recognized Viking Capitalists to find their houses covered in red paint.  Then, on 20 January, while Barack Obama was being sworn into office on  Capitol  Hill  in  Washington,  the  people  of  Iceland  started  the  first  revolution  in  the  history  of  the  republic.  The  weather  was  unseason-ably mild when Parliament resumed in Reykjavik that Tuesday after the traditional  Christmas  and  New  Year  break.  Many  thought  that  it  was  illustrative of how out of touch Parliament was with the ordinary public that  the  first  item  on  its  agenda  was  a  bill  proposing  minor  changes  to the country’s alcohol laws. By noon, the crowds had already grown larger  than  before.  The  police  were  now  having  trouble  protecting  the  Parliament  building,  which  had  been  surrounded  by  protesters.  Parliamentarians were locked behind the stone and brick walls, though some were able to sneak out through a secret tunnel leading to a neigh-bouring house. The ritualistic mantra had now grown into a continuous cacophony of drumming masses. In the evening, protesters kept warm by lighting bonfires and burning torches in front of the building. This added  a  dramatic  visualization  to  the  distinctive  musical  aesthetics  of  this unprecedented event in Iceland’s history. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":154,"content":"The Pots and Pans Revolution – and Defiance Abroad 145 A noteworthy aspect of the nature of the Pots and Pans Revolution can be found in what happened when the protest seemed to be getting out of hand, for example when the police found itself late one evening being stoned with cobbles from the pavements. When pepper spray and tear gas failed to keep the rioters away, a group of more peaceful protesters broke  ranks  and  shielded  the  police  from  the  stone-throwing  hooli-gans. This event started what became known as the Orange Group – a citizens’ movement promoting protest while also condemning any sort of  violence.  This  changed  the  nature  of  the  protests;  violence  mostly  ended when it was noticed that most protesters were wearing orange in support of peaceful protest.  Though the tide had surely turned, the excessive and out-of-touch high-society culture of the boom years had not yet completely disappeared. A surreal encounter occurred when a group of artists were heading with their  hand-painted  posters  to  the  Parliament  lawn.  On  their  way  they  heard a familiar voice call in English from a balcony above: ‘Darlings, come  up  and  have  some  champagne!’  The  voice  belonged  to  wealthy  Baroness Francesca von Habsburg, a patron of the arts and friend of the President’s  wife.  Some  of  the  now  protesting  artists  had  once  enjoyed  her  hospitality  and  graciousness,  so  they  stopped  for  a  glass  of  cham-pagne,  which  they  drank  from  crystal  glasses  while  rubbing  shoulders  with  diamond-wearing  members  of  international  high  society  before  heading out to join the other protesters banging on their pots and pans (Ásmundsson, 2009).  While  the  IP  leadership  mostly  still  remained  defiant  in  the  face  of  the protesters’ demands, many SDA members were growing increasingly uneasy. It added to the complexity of the situation that the SDA’s leader, Mrs Ingibjörg Gísladóttir, was still fighting brain cancer and was during these dramatic days again away, this time in a Swedish hospital. Many party members thought it would to be too rebellious to end the coali-tion without her. Further adding to the strained atmosphere, the leader of IP, Prime Minister Haarde, was also diagnosed with cancer and would as well need to seek treatment abroad. This unavoidably weakened the country’s  political  leadership.  The  very  fabric  of  society  seemed  to  be  coming apart at the seams. Many protesters felt guilty about revolting against  sick  leaders.  On  Gísladóttir’s  return,  on  Friday  23  January,  the  relevant  party  apparatuses  of  the  SDA,  however,  passed  resolutions  calling for an end to the coalition. The Minister for Commerce, Björgvin Sigurðsson,  resigned  on  Saturday  while  also  dissolving  the  board  of  the  financial  supervisory  authority.  On  Monday,  Gísladóttir  formally  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":155,"content":"146   Iceland and the International Financial Crisistold PM Haarde that the SDA no longer supported his government and offered her resignation.  This is how it happened that the Icelandic government was the first to collapse in the global financial crisis, ousted from power in what became known  as  the  Pots  and  Pans  Revolution.  The  word  ‘revolution’  might  sound a bit of an overstatement, but given the calm temperament that usually prevails in Icelandic politics, the unfolding events represent, at the very least, a revolution in political activism. No one died, few were injured and just 12 protesters faced prosecution for violence. According to research conducted at the University of Iceland, a quarter of Reykjavik’s inhabitants participated at least once in the January protests (Bernburg et al., 2010). Opinion polls indicated that two-thirds of the population generally supported the protests (Tveir þriðju, 2009).    Left-leaning landslide  Before   the   government’s   downfall,   a   new   leadership   within   the   Progressive  Party  had  offered  to  support  a  minority  caretaker  govern-ment of the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left Green Movement (LGM)  until  early  elections  were  held  in  the  spring.  This  was  a  time  of  political  turmoil.  Having  been  accused  of  co-sponsoring  the  failed  neoliberal model, the PP had been in ruins after leaving a longstanding coalition with the IP in 2007. By early 2009, the party had a completely new leadership, headed by novice Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson, who had been at the forefront of the InDefence group and one of the most defiant voices  against  the  foreign  pressure  Iceland  had  faced  over  the  Icesave  accounts.  Jóhanna  Sigurðardóttir,  Minister  of  Social  Affairs  in  the  ousted  government,  who  had  belonged  to  the  more  critical  left  wing  of  the  SDA,  led  the  new  minority  left-wing  government,  which  took  office  on 1 February. She not only became Iceland’s first female PM but also the  world’s  first  openly  gay  head  of  government.  Usually,  the  leader  of  the  larger  coalition  party  would  head  the  government.  SDA  leader  Gísladóttir had, however, already exhausted her political capital in the co-operation with the IP and was also still recovering from brain cancer. Sigurðardóttir, often accused of being a stubborn and eccentric idealist, seemed at the time to be the only politician in the country who still had credibility. A long-standing campaigner for social reform and a vigilant fighter against corruption, she was the only person whom both the LGM and the SDA – and in fact the protesting public – would accept at the ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":156,"content":"The Pots and Pans Revolution – and Defiance Abroad 147time.  Approaching  retirement  age,  she  had  in  the  boom  years  rather  been sidelined within the party. Now, however, her time had come.  2    The situation was grave when the minority government took office. The public debt level had grown well above a year’s GDP, the CDS spread on the state stubbornly remained at a staggering 820 points above Libor, and our currency had more than halved in value despite being locked behind  capital  controls.  With  massive  losses  in  tax  revenues,  it  would  take years to bridge the vast state budget deficit. In addition, it was esti-mated  that  close  to  half  of  households  were  in  negative  equity,  while  the housing market remained frozen. The building industry was wiped out,  car  dealerships  were  closing  and  shops  were  empty  of  customers.  Businesses were filing for bankruptcy in record numbers while mass lay-offs  were  still  increasing.  Many  responded  by  moving  abroad,  mostly  to Norway, which seemed to have well paid jobs for anyone willing to emigrate.  Though the task ahead was herculean, the left-wing parties felt quite comfortable when seeing their support surge. In the late April 2009 elec-tion, the SDA and LGM earned a healthy majority in a landslide to the left and emerged as the country’s first purely left-wing majority govern-ment, headed by Sigurðardóttir, who had by now become the leader of the SDA. The IP suffered its greatest loss in history but the PP was able to prevent being wiped out by throwing out the old guard and parachuting in a completely new leadership. The Icelandic party system allows room for a variable, fifth party and sometimes also a sixth, alongside the four main  parties.  A  new  such  party  called  the  Citizens  Movement,  estab-lished by a group of protesters, was able to pass the 5 per cent threshold and slot into 4 of the 63 seats.    The Icesave dispute heightens  The  new  left-wing  government  contested  some  of  the  premises  of  the  Brussels  Guidelines  in  the  amended  first  Icesave  deal,  which  they  claimed was unlawfully imposed by foreign forces. Under the leadership of Finance Minister Sigfússon, chairman of the LGM, the new govern-ment abandoned the multinational approach of the Brussels Guidelines and  instead  sent  their  representatives  to  London  and  The  Hague  to  renegotiate terms. The new agreement reached with the two countries’ finance ministries stipulated that Iceland would get a seven-year grace period without payments in return for agreeing to foot the part of the bill that the fallen Landsbanki’s assets would not cover. The payments ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":157,"content":"148   Iceland and the International Financial Crisiswere to be made between 2016 and 2023. Interest was brought down to 5.5 per cent. The British and the Dutch governments had already paid out to depositors. This result, which in effect was merely a loan agree-ment with the foreign ministers of the Netherlands and the UK, where Iceland accepted to cover up to €4.5 billion, instantly became one of the most unpopular agreements in the history of the country. Only after its signing, however, was Iceland’s name removed from the list of terrorist regimes on the UK Chancellor’s website.  Parliament reluctantly accepted the agreement, but only after adding to it new preconditions, referring to Iceland’s ability to pay. These the UK and the Dutch refused. A new negotiation committee was thus formed, which  was  able  to  lower  the  interest  rate  a  little  further.  After  a  fierce  debate, the amended agreement was accepted in Parliament on the last day of December 2009. Our new government was now also accused of caving  in  to  foreign  pressure  and  surrendering  Icelandic  interests  to  external  forces.  The  government  also  saw  a  rebellion  within  its  own  ranks, with five of its MPs abstaining and the Health Minister resigning in protest.  The saga took a dramatic turn on 5 January 2010, when the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, denied signing the law necessary to ratify the new agreement after receiving a petition of 60,000 Icelanders asking him to reject the deal. This was an exceptional move. Our elected President has traditionally been a symbolic figure rather than one with any real power. Usually, it is a mere formality for the President to sign parliamentary  bills;  only  once  before  had  the  President  rejected  one.  The constitution says that when the President refuses a bill, the matter shall be put to a national referendum. In the previous incident, however, the  legislation  was  simply  withdrawn  by  the  government.  The  second  Icesave bill thus became the first such parliamentary issue to be put to the public.  Refusing the bill was an extraordinary but a highly popular move on the part of President Grímsson, who was able to claw his way out of the doghouse that he had found himself stuck in after The Crash, when he had  been  accused  of  having  been  the  main  cheerleader  of  the  Viking  Capitalists:  travelling  in  their  private  jets,  extolling  them  in  the  inter-national media and providing them with the credibility of his office. A sarcastic  and  humiliating  depiction  of  the  President  was,  for  example,  the running gag in the vastly popular annual New Year’s Eve TV comedy programme, which almost the entire population always watches.  In early 2010, Icelanders once again found themselves in unknown waters. A quarter of the electorate had signed a petition to be put to ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":158,"content":"The Pots and Pans Revolution – and Defiance Abroad 149the  President  asking  him  to  veto  the  bill,  which  subsequently  was  refused by 90 per cent of voters. The country was in a mood of defi-ance. Many felt betrayed by the UK government when it had invoked the Anti-Terrorist Act – an action that ultimately drove our last bank into the ground. Icelanders therefore found the idea that they should foot  the  whole  bill  alone  difficult  to  swallow.  There  was  also  a  legal  twist. The EU directive upon which the British and Dutch had based their claim was rather unclear. It stipulated only that states are obliged to set up special deposit guarantee schemes. It did not speak of a state guarantee. Many Icelanders were thus frustrated by the fact that the British and the Dutch had refused our request for an impartial court to rule on the issue.  The general perception in Iceland was thus that our government had been bullied by an overwhelming foreign power into signing an unjust agreement. It is generally accepted that our government and Parliament only accepted the initial deal to achieve other ends, rather than because they felt under obligation to pay. It was simply a necessary evil to gain access to the IMF. And then there was the cost. €4.5 billon might have seemed a small figure by UK standards but this was almost half our GDP. Divided by Iceland’s small population, the bill amounted to more than €12,000 per head, or just under €50,000 per household. If Landsbanki’s assets deteriorated any further, this would place a devastating burden on an already debt-ridden population.  The rhetoric some UK leaders were using in the dispute was a further source of frustration. During Prime Minister’s questions in the House of Commons  on  6  May  2009,  PM  Gordon  Brown  said  that  the  Icelandic  authorities were responsible for the loss of the cancer charity Christie’s in  Manchester  and  claimed  to  be  in  discussion  with  the  IMF  on  how  Iceland would repay the losses it was responsible for. Brown went on to wash his hands of the matter and repeatedly said that the UK was not the regulatory authority. This was, however, not true. Christie’s business was  with  Kaupthing’s  Singer  &  Friedlander,  a  UK-based  bank  that  was  regulated by the British FSA and therefore covered by the UK depositor protection  scheme.  This  was  clearly  stated  in  the  House  of  Commons  Treasury  Committee  report  (2009)  published  in  April  2009.  Not  only  was  Brown’s  statement  false  but  in  fact  the  opposite  could  be  argued.  By  killing  off  Kaupthing,  the  Labour  government  was  itself  partly  to  blame  for  the  troubles  Christie’s  was  facing.  Many  felt  that  in  attrib-uting  blame  to  Iceland  Brown  was  once  again  trying  to  save  his  own  political skin: now, with regard to the troubles of the cancer charity in Manchester, which he himself was partly responsible for. Leading up to ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":159,"content":"150   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisthe referendum this sort of rhetoric in the UK only fuelled the No camp in Iceland.  In  addition  to  the  wide-ranging  general  feeling  of  frustration,  the  appearance of leniency towards the British and Dutch spurred a new wave of  protest  in  mid-2010,  which  heightened  when  Parliament  resumed  in  the  early  autumn,  to  find  thousands  of  protesters  surrounding  the  building,  once  again.  Flags  symbolizing  Iceland’s  independence  could  now be seen flying high in front of the Parliament building. Amongst them were blue EU flags on which a red no-entry sign had been painted right across the yellow stars.  After twice going back on signed agreements, the government found it difficult to go knocking on doors in London and The Hague asking to renegotiate the deal once again. Headed by a hired American negotiator, our new team was nevertheless in the end able to bring the interest rate down to 3 per cent. This time, a large majority emerged in Parliament when  the  IP  joined  ranks  with  the  government  in  backing  the  new  deal.  Only  the  Progressive  Party  still  opposed  any  agreement.  Yet,  to  the surprise of most, President Grímsson also refused the third bill.  3   In a second referendum, on 9 April 2011, the new agreement was refused by a two-thirds majority, illustrating a clear division between Parliament and  the  public.  Now,  there  was  no  longer  anything  to  negotiate.  The  case  was  sent  to  the  EFTA  Court,  where  the  EU  was  backing  the  claim  of the UK and the Netherlands against Iceland. Finally, on 28 January 2013, the court ruled in favour of Iceland, which was vindicated of any wrongdoing  in  its  handling  of  the  Icesave  deposits  (Judgment  of  the  Court, 2013).    Post-crisis discourse  To understand the sentiments that arose when Icelanders felt themselves under siege by foreign forces, it is helpful to analyse the discourse used. At once, the dispute with the British and Dutch governments fell into familiar  trenches  of  nationalistic  rhetoric.  Tapping  into  this  rhetoric,  prominent figures claimed that Iceland was a victim of vicious foreigners who  had  conspired  to  bring  Iceland  to  its  knees.  Commentators  explained  how  we  had  come  under  siege  by  the  ‘central  banks  of  the  US,  UK,  Holland,  Europe,  Luxembourg  and  the  Nordic  states,  which  joined  hands  to  lock  us  in  while  the  British  FME  launched  an  attack  on Landsbanki’ (Gunnarsson, 2009).

Many  parliamentarians  echoed  this  notion  of  a  European-led conspiracy and some said they would not accept anyone from  the  Nordic  states  as  a  mediator  between  Iceland  and  the  British  and  Dutch  governments,  as  they  had  aligned  with  the  EU  against  Iceland (Hreyfingin, 2010). When the amended agreement was drafted in June 2009, the government was instantly accused of high treason by the  opposition  and  pundits.   4    PP  leader  Mr  Sigmundur  Gunnlaugsson,  who  was  to  replace  Mrs  Jóhanna  Sigurðardóttir  as  PM  in  spring  2013,  accused  her  of  ‘humiliating  the  nation’  by  ‘forcing  her  nation  to  pay  the Icesave debt burden’  5  . Instead of protecting the nation, he claimed, the government was working on behalf of the British and the Dutch to attack Iceland. When he became Prime Minister himself, Gunnlaugsson used the PM’s traditional celebratory address on Iceland’s national day, 17  June,  to  remind  us  that  the  EU  had  participated  in  the  dispute  in  an  illegal  attempt  to  coerce  Icelanders  to  accept  enormous  burdens  (Gunnlaugsson, 2013).  When  the  result  of  the  first  referendum  became  clear,  the  President  was quick to exploit Iceland’s wish to be recognized as an equal in the modern  international  system.  He  explained  how  the  referendum  on  Icesave would have an impact on a global scale. Referring – like histo-rian Jónsson Aðils at the turn of the century – to ancient Athens and the US constitutional convention in Philadelphia, he insisted not only that the vote mattered for Icelanders but that it ‘had changed people’s views around the world on the way that it was possible to develop democracy and bring direct power to the people in this new century.’ He said that all around the world people were asking why they had not got the rights Icelanders enjoyed (Grímsson, 2010).  The  Icesave  dispute  was  directly  linked  with  the  debate  on  EU  membership. After explaining how the EU had forced Iceland to agree to an unjust deal, one parliamentarian (IP) said it was strange that any Icelander  would  like  ‘to  join  this  club  that  is  beating  on  us’   6    Another  (LGM) was offended by the fact that Iceland was applying for member-ship at the same time as the big countries in the EU were ‘shamelessly forcing  a  nation  like  ours  to  surrender  to  their  interests’   7  .  Associated  with the country’s historical enemies, the European Union was repeat-edly  referred  to  as  a  club  of  former  colonizers  –  contrary  to  Iceland,  which  had  been  colonized  by  one  of  its  members,  Denmark.  An  MP  for  the  Citizens’  Movement  explained:  ‘Iceland  is  an  old  colony  and  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":161,"content":"152   Iceland and the International Financial Crisiswe  are  negotiating  with  historical  colonizers  who  have  not  protected  their colonies in the past. Are we going to surrender to becoming their colony?’  8  .  Similarly, the new IP leader, Bjarni Benediktsson, referred to the most historically important quote of Iceland’s independence struggle: ‘We all protest.’ The main leader of the independence struggle, Jón Sigurðsson, had  voiced  those  words  when  protesting  against  the  Danish  authority  after  it  had  unilaterally  ended  Iceland’s  Constitutional  Assembly  in  1851.  Benediktsson  said  that  Iceland  should  now  send  the  UK  the  same  message   9  .  Another  example  is  found  on  the  blog  of  the  anti-EU  ‘Organization for Research on the European Union, and on its Relations to Iceland’, when it emphasized that the most powerful EU members – at least ten of the then EU-27 (amounting to two-thirds of the vote within the Council) – were former colonizers, whom Iceland should stay away from (Tíu aflóga, 2012).  After  a  long-drawn  out  dispute,  the  Icesave  agreements  appeared  to  have become the most unpopular since the Old Treaty with Norway in 1262, when according to the national myth Iceland’s economy started to  deteriorate  after  it  had  fallen  under  foreign  rule  and  entered  into  a  period of humiliation by losing its independence.  The  change  in  the  national  rhetoric,  from  the  superiority  discourse  of the boom years discussed in a previous chapter to the idea of being under  siege  by  ill-willed  foreigners  after  The  Crash  of  2008,  was  quite  rapid. On the surface it might even seem that those two ideas were in contradiction. However, when analysing the harsh nationalistic rhetoric of the Icesave debate, it can be seen that it had the same origin as the rhetoric  on  the  Icelandic  economic  miracle  heard  in  the  first  decade  of  the  new  millennium:  Iceland’s  postcolonial  national  identity.  The  core  of  both  ideas  is  found  in  the  national  myth  created  during  the  independent struggle in the 19th century, written down by Jón Jónsson Aðils at the beginning of the 20th century and kept alive and nourished by  politicians  of  all  ranks  throughout  the  decades  and  then  put  into  new perspectives by the likes of President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson. As Jón  Jónsson  Aðils  did  more  than  a  century  ago  when  describing  the  old settlement society, President Grímsson linked modern Iceland with ancient Greece.

When the British and the  Dutch  increased  the  pressure,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  was called in to stabilize the economy and co-funded a loan package together  with  the  Nordic  and  Polish  governments.  The  suffocating  feeling of surrendering to foreign forces in the Icesave dispute further added to public frustration. The government thus stood accused of not only failing to protect our economic well-being but also of caving in to foreign oppression, which was in direct violation of our postcolonial national identity.  Amid a series of protests, which became known as the Pots and Pans Revolution, the IP/SDA coalition government fell in January 2009 and was replaced by a fragile left-wing caretaker coalition. The protest gradu-ally gained momentum and grew into flood of events, which through theatrical,  musical  and  rhetorical  means  developed  their  own  identi-fying aesthetics. A left-leaning landslide in the ensuing election saw the minority government win a healthy majority. Though the government faced astronomical difficulties in restructuring the collapsed economy, it was its handling of the Icesave issue that first undermined its credibility in the eyes of the voters.  An  interesting  shift  in  public  opinion  occurred  after  the  President  refused  the  government’s  proposed  solution.  The  President  had  stood  accused of having become a cheerleader for the Viking Capitalists in the boom years while most government ministers were thought to have been free of any such corruption. The table turned in the wake of the refer-endum. The President, who had lost credibility in the eyes of the public and  had  by  end  of  2009  all  but  been  laughed  out  of  office,  suddenly  became  the  country’s  principal  hero.  The  leaders  of  the  new  left-wing  government  were  then  in  their  turn  accused  of  sacrificing  Icelandic  interests  while  surrendering  to  the  will  of  foreign  forces.  The  public  thus not only revolted against the IP/SDA government which collapsed during  the  Pots  and  Pans  Revolution  but  also  turned  in  a  similar  way  against  the  new  left-wing  government  when  they  believed  it  was  not  holding its ground against foreign pressure.  When  studying  the  post-crisis  discourse,  we  see  Iceland’s  postco-lonial  identity  emerging  through  the  domestic  language  game,  with  an  emphasis  on  formal  sovereignty,  which  insulated  Iceland  against  submission  to  foreign  authority.  This  is  what  characterizes  the  rhetor-ical  manoeuvring:  both  insisting  on  formal  sovereignty  and  striving  for external recognition as being an equal partner with its neighbours.

The  small  island  was  severely hit in autumn 2008, when 90 per cent of its financial system, including its three main banks, collapsed. The tiny currency lost more than half its pre-crisis value, inflation escalated and unemployment rose rapidly,  with  an  avalanche  of  bankruptcies  in  its  wake.  While  govern-ment  expenditure  surged,  the  state’s  revenues  were  evaporating.  The  economy  contracted  by  almost  13  per  cent  from  its  peak  in  late  2007  while both public and private debt grew way beyond sustainable levels. The country was financially devastated.  The  severity  of  the  crisis  called  for  extraordinary  measures.  While  neighbouring  states  were  frantically  bailing  out  banks  by  pumping  capital into the system and issuing public guarantees to private banks, Iceland was not able to follow suit. In late September 2008, Ireland, for example, provided a blanket guarantee for all liabilities of banks domi-ciled in Eire. This was only deemed credible because of backing from the ECB – and thus also from Germany. Without access to enough foreign currency to prevent its big banks, by then worth nine times GDP, from collapsing,  the  Icelandic  state  had  no  other  option  than  to  take  them  into administration. This approach contrasts with responses elsewhere and is thus a unique case in this crisis.  When  new  domestic  banks  were  established  out  of  the  ruins  of  the  fallen  ones,  most  of  the  old  banks’  liabilities  fell  on  the  shoulders  of  foreign  creditors.  Though  this  was  indeed  contrary  to  responses  in  most  neighbouring  states,  where  the  state  emptied  its  coffers  and  sent  a huge bill to future taxpayers, the public cost of the Icelandic banking collapse  was  also  severe.

Introducing capital controls was thus deemed  necessary,  as  well  as  locking  in  the  foreign  creditors  when  the  fallen  banks  were  being  wound  up  and  pressure  on  the  króna  further  increased.  When  the  fierce  dispute  with  the  Dutch  and  the  British  over  the  Icesave  deposit  accounts  was  temporarily  calmed  in  November  2008,  the IMF arrived in Reykjavik with a handsome rescue package. In order to  stabilize  the  currency  further,  the  interest  rate  was  hiked  to  18  per  cent. In a highly unorthodox move in relation to its previous positions elsewhere,  the  fund  supported  extensive  capital  controls  and  allowed  the left-wing government to implement its policy of mixed measures to deal  with  the  crisis  rather  than  forcing  through  strict  austerity,  which  for example was the case in the PIIGS – Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain.  The sharp concentration of the economy finally stopped in late 2010, with  modest  growth  in  2012  and  2013.  The  fisheries  still  generated  healthy foreign income. In June 2011, Iceland re-entered capital markets with the successfully auction of $1 billion worth of bonds at a premium below  that  offered  by  many  crisis-ridden  states.  Subsequently,  rating  agencies lifted Iceland again from junk bond status to investment level. Many workers who had lost their jobs in the crisis, left the country, most of  them  heading  to  Norway.  In  early  2013,  the  flow  reversed  as  more  people came back than left. A further vital contribution to the recovery was that, despite the financial sector’s devastation, many of our interna-tional production companies, which had also grown rapidly during the boom  years,  were  able  to  survive  the  turmoil  and  generate  significant  foreign currency income.  In this chapter I will analyse Iceland’s fragile economic recovery. The next chapter deals with strives for accompanying political reform.    The IMF emergency programme  Many measures had been taken during and immediately after The Crash to insulate the state from excessive amounts of bad debt when the banks fell  and  to  minimize  socialization  of  private  sector  losses.  However,  without the IMF rescue package the state was almost sure to default on its obligations, which might have locked us out of international markets for years (Guðmundsson, 2013).

Iceland had been frozen out  in  terms  of  diplomatic  relations.  Suffering  the  deepest  crisis  in  its  postwar  history,  the  country  was  already  sucked  dry  of  foreign  cash  when the IMF finally opened its doors in November 2008, after we had, under  coercion,  finally  agreed  to  guarantee  the  Icesave  deposits.  The  emergency  programme  provided  financing  amounting  to  $5.1  billion  in total. $2.1 billion came from the IMF’s coffers. The rest was from the Nordic states and Poland.  The seriousness of the situation was such that the IMF Mission Chief to Iceland, Paul Thomsen, described it as unprecedented. Three years later, when Iceland had successfully completed the programme, he explained how  during  The  Crash  Iceland  had  suffered  a  ‘near-death  experience’  (Thomsen, 2011).  Renewed access to foreign currency allowed us to build credible foreign currency reserves. The flipside, however, was that taking on foreign loans also makes it difficult to re-enter international capital markets. The pres-sure  on  the  króna  was  such  that  comprehensive  capital  controls  were  viewed as a key element of the programme. Had the carry traders and cred-itors of the fallen banks been allowed to leave, the currency would surely have  tanked.  This  solution  of  implementing  capital  controls  was  a  vital  break from the IMF’s traditional practice. Usually, the fund insisted on the free flow of capital and was adamant in pushing through strict austerity measures. Iceland thus saw a softer side of the IMF than others had previ-ously faced. For the most part, rather than forcing through its traditional neoliberal  one-size-fits-all  design,  the  fund  agreed  to  our  government’s  own economic programme. Indeed, the IMF agreed to use a greater variety of economic tools than was usually found in its toolkit. It can be argued that we were at this time in a favourable position, as the IMF was eagerly shopping for a success story after years of harsh criticism. Three main goals were set: stabilization of the exchange rate, fiscal sustainability and recon-struction of the financial sector (Guðmundsson, 2013).    Bank restructuring  During  the  crisis,  countries  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic  saw  banks  fail,  but  most  were  bailed  out  in  one  way  or  another  by  their  respec-tive  governments  –  though  some  were  allowed  to  default.  What  set  Iceland worlds apart from the others was that the country’s entire over-sized financial system collapsed virtually in one go: the three big banks in  October  2008  and  most  of  the  large  investment  companies  in  the  following months. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":167,"content":"158   Iceland and the International Financial Crisis Small domestic banks were raised on the ruins of the fallen cross-border ones. Arion Bank was created out of Kaupthing, Glitnir’s domestic opera-tions were renamed Íslandsbanki and the old Landsbanki simply became the new Landsbanki. Local deposits were moved to the new entities, as were  domestic  loans,  which  were  transferred  at  a  discount  price  –  the  write-off on average was around 50 per cent. This, though, only accounted for about a tenth of the old banks’ bloated balance sheets. In line with the 6 October emergency law, the rest, mainly international operations, was  put  into  administration.  It  was  then  the  task  of  court-appointed  returning committees to wind up the assets of the fallen banks, most of which lay outside Iceland. The old banks were thus in effect turned into asset management firms with the primary aim of returning to creditors as much value as possible from their foreign assets. The new banks were right from the beginning quite well funded. With also cash instalments from  the  government  they  were  started  off  with  equity  amounting  to  around 13 per cent of GDP. Their combined balance sheet was roughly twice GDP, down from nine times before The Crash (Alþingi, 2011).  It should be stressed that even though Iceland was able to cut off most of the banks’ liabilities abroad, it still had to foot a large bill. According to an OECD calculation, Iceland suffered the second-greatest direct fiscal cost of all OECD states in this crisis, amounting to 20 per cent of GDP. Only Ireland had to shoulder more per-capita cost. Ireland in fact sepa-rated completely from the pack, with a spectacular direct cost of almost half its GDP. In comparison, the cost to the UK was well below 10 per cent (OECD, 2011). In the end, the cost of the crisis was such that public debt  in  Iceland  rose  from  below  30  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2007  to  over  100 per cent of GDP in 2010. One of the largest one-off bills stemmed from the bankruptcy of the Central Bank, amounting to 13 per cent of GDP – which is amongst the many special Icelandic features of this crisis (Byrne & Þorsteinsson, 2012).  Controlling  stakes  in  two  of  the  three  new  banks,  Arion  Bank  and  Íslandsbanki,  were  handed  over  to  creditors,  but  Landsbanki  was  kept  in  public  ownership  –  partly  because  of  the  trouble  over  the  Icesave  deposits. The new owners of Arion and Íslandsbanki were mostly foreign hedge funds, which had acquired the bonds at rock bottom prices in the secondary market after The Crash. Most of them were looking to quickly get out for as wide a margin as possible.  Iceland’s  relations  with  its  neighbours  for  the  most  part  normalized  when the IMF arrived in Reykjavik. There were, however, still examples of  foreign  authorities  exploiting  the  volatile  situation  to  squeeze  out  assets. One such case is found in events around the Danish FIH Bank. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":168,"content":"Rising from the Ruins – A Fragile Economic Recovery 159Our Central Bank had come into possession of the Danish investment bank  when  Kaupthing  collapsed.  In  early  2011,  the  Danish  financial  supervisory authority suddenly called for more cash to insure its opera-tion, thus tightened the thumbscrews and in effect forced the sale of the bank, threatening otherwise to take it into receivership – rendering its shares worthless. Iceland’s Central Bank had in October 2008 taken the bank as collateral against a €500 million emergency loan to Kaupthing just  a  day  before  its  collapse.  In  the  sale  pressed  by  the  Danish  FSA  only €255 million was paid out, with up to twice that amount due in 2015, depending on the performance of the bank up to that point. Poor performance of the bank in that period would mean that the CB had lost most of its worth (Lán Seðlabankans, 2012).    Welfare-orientated recovery  The  crisis  blew  a  black  hole  into  the  state’s  coffers.  A  quarter  of  the  state’s revenues evaporated with the collapse of the banks, while public expenditure  shot  up,  along  with  costs.  The  government  thus  had  to  bridge an impossible gap. Its focus was on protecting the Nordic welfare model,  thus  shielding  the  lowest  income  group  while  shuffling  costs  onto  the  upper  classes.  Against  its  previous  practices,  the  IMF  agreed  to  our  left-wing  government’s  proposal  to  tackle  the  budget  deficit  over time and through mixed measures instead of implementing strict austerity.  The  $5.1  billion  currency  loan  provided  a  necessary  buffer.  Public services were, however, still cut significantly three years in a row while  taxes  were  gradually  raised  to  just  below  36  per  cent  of  GDP  in  almost a hundred different changes to the tax code.  While taxes on higher-income groups were significantly increased, the tax burden on the lower strata was brought down even further. Several additional  measures  were  introduced  mainly  to  cushion  the  lowest  income groups. Those on lower salaries, for example, were shielded from nominal  wage  cuts.  Redistribution  mechanisms  such  as  benefits  and  interest subsidies were also strengthened and welfare measures further geared towards the lowest level. From 2008 to 2010, the average dispos-able  income  of  households  fell  by  27  per  cent.  In  the  lowest  income  group, however, the fall was only 9 per cent, at the middle level it was 14 per cent, while the highest income group suffered a full 38 per cent drop (for more, see Ólafsson & Kristjánsson, 2012). This was significantly different from the strict austerity measures in many other countries. In Ireland, for example, the lower income level was shouldering even more of the burden than the upper level. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":169,"content":"160   Iceland and the International Financial Crisis Ranking 14th out of the 34 OECD countries, Iceland still had a gener-ally  lower  tax  level  than  the  other  Nordic  states  (Þorláksson,  2013).  Significant new fees on fishing quotas were also introduced (though later abolished  again  by  the  right-of-centre  government  that  took  power  in  mid-2013). The budget deficit, which had risen to 13.5 per cent of GDP in 2009, was reduced to 2.5 per cent by 2011, when the IMF programme ended, finally reaching small primary budget surplus in 2012. For 2014, six years after The Crash, the budget was more or less balanced.    Production base intact  Our  tiny  currency,  the  króna,  also  factored  significantly  into  both  the  build-up to the crisis and then also the apparent recovery in the after-math.  An  independent  currency  exaggerates  economic  cycles  at  both  ends:  it  increases  the  risk  of  collapse  but  also  helps  in  turning  the  economy around after a collapse. The smallest currency in the world on free float, the ISK lost half its value in 2008, the crisis year. With most loans linked either to inflation or to foreign currency, the sharp devalu-ation led to spiked debt and rocketing prices, resulting in a much higher cost of living.  On  the  other  side  of  that  equation,  however,  the  devalued  currency  also  provided  sudden  stimulus  to  the  export  industry.  The  prolonged  double-digit  current  account  deficit  rapidly  reversed  and  grew  into  a  surplus, in the region of 3 to 4 per cent a year. This is especially impor-tant, as the root of Iceland’s relatively rapid recovery is to be found in the fact that the production base remained intact.  With the financial sector gone, we were able to fall back on fishing, which still generated significant income in foreign currency, amounting to  a  yearly  export  value  of  more  than  €5,000  per  inhabitant  (see  Íslandsbanki,  2012).  Furthermore,  many  of  our  main  international  production companies, which had also grown rapidly during the boom years,  survived  the  storm  and  were  in  the  wake  of  the  crisis  able  to  bring foreign income into cash-thirsty Iceland. Among them were food processing  company  Marel  and  prepared  food  producer  Bakkavör,  as  well as the many fish production companies. Adding to the pool we can also count world-leading orthopaedics producer Össur and pharmaceu-tical manufacturer Actavis.  The  robust  production  power  found  in  Iceland’s  fishing  grounds  and  the  strength  of  these  production  companies  is  really  what  kept  Iceland afloat. There is, though, a limit to further growth, as fishing and aluminium  production,  which  collectively  account  for  80  per  cent  of  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":170,"content":"Rising from the Ruins – A Fragile Economic Recovery 161Iceland’s  merchandize  exports,  both  face  natural  capacity  constraints.  These limitations are, however, not on the IT industry or tourism, which also have flourished.    Debt restructuring  Several measures were taken to deal with the unsustainable debt burden many  households  faced  after  the  collapse  of  the  currency.  Parliament  passed  numerous  laws  increasing  the  rights  of  debtors,  for  example,  making  it  more  difficult  to  evict  people  from  their  homes  and  repos-sesses of assets. A new institution, the Debtors’ Ombudsman, was estab-lished to protect the interests of borrowers against their creditors, with powers to force through debt reduction. Real house prices had dropped by 30 per cent. Loans exceeding the value of the property were brought down to 110 per cent of market value. The tax system was also used to repay some of the interest on housing loans. Many measures were taken to  alleviate  pressure  on  households,  including  allowing  early  pension  withdrawals.  Foreign  currency  loans,  which  had  shot  up  with  the  collapse  of  the  króna, were suffocating many households. The pressure was somewhat alleviated  in  mid-2009  when  the  Supreme  Court  ruled  many  of  them  unlawful.  As  it  turned  out,  linking  housing  and  consumer  loans  to  a  foreign exchange index, in the way that the banks had formulated many of them, was in violation of Icelandic laws on the structure of loan agree-ments. This cut much of the short-term car loan debt from many debt-ridden households. Furthermore, a large fraction of the foreign currency exposure was in holding companies that had already defaulted and was cut off (Halldórsson & Zoega, 2010).  Collectively,  these  examples  of  debt  restructuring  and  write-offs  brought the country’s debt level down significantly. They were mostly provided  to  businesses  that  had  grown  debts  far  beyond  sustainable  levels. Ordinary households, however, also significantly benefitted from the measures. Household debt dropped from 132 per cent of GDP in 2009 to around 100 per cent in early 2013. One criticism prevailed, however: that the Viking Capitalists and reckless borrowers were being rewarded with  most  of  these  write-offs,  thus  undermining  the  legitimacy  of  the  efforts.  The  ordinary  public  gradually  grew  frustrated  at  always  being  asked to foot the bill for other people’s recklessness.  The turn-around of the economy started in late 2010 and continued in 2011. In June of that year, for example, Iceland was able to re-access international markets by selling $1 billion worth of five-year bonds at ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":171,"content":"162   Iceland and the International Financial Crisis3.2  per  cent  above  Libor,  which  was  well  below  the  premium  many  other  crisis-ridden  states  had  to  pay.  In  May  2012,  another  $1  billion  was  raised  on  ten-year  bonds.  Part  of  the  proceeds  was  used  to  repay  more than half the IMF loan provided by the Nordics and Poland well before its maturity. Predictions that Iceland would for decades be locked out of international markets because of not bailing out its banks and for not agreeing to guarantee Icesave were thus proven wrong.  To help alleviate currency trade pressure, the Central Bank regularly held foreign exchange auctions at which it bought currency for krónas at a favourable rate for investors, to be used for long-term domestic invest-ment. Concurrently with these auctions, foreign investors were invited to  sell  ISK  at  a  lower  price  in  exchange  for  foreign  currency.  In  these  cross-actions the Central Bank aimed to bring together actors interested in  long-term  investment  in  Iceland  and  investors  looking  to  unwind  their  króna  position,  without  destabilizing  the  exchange  rate.  Within  these measures were also bond swaps in which the Central Bank issued long-term liabilities in foreign currency for Icelandic assets (Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, 2013).    Rising from the ruins  Only the Baltic three and Ireland suffered greater economic contraction than Iceland. Iceland, however, topped the list of crisis-ridden states in terms of the fall in purchasing power of disposable income (Ólafsson & Kristjánsson, 2012). After three years of sharp contraction, the economy started to grow again in late 2010 and expanded by 2.6 per cent in 2011 and by 2.4 per cent in 2012. The output gap, which had averaged around 3  per  cent  a  year  after  the  crisis,  was  essentially  closed  (International  Monetary Fund, 2012). The growth, which however was set to slow again in 2013, was mostly driven by domestic demand: private consumption and investment, which after a sharp contraction grew again, in addition to increased exports. Essentially, per-capita GDP and disposable income were set to be similar in 2013 to their 2005 levels (Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, 2013).  The  prolonged  trade  deficit  in  the  boom  years  had  also  reversed  to  a  surplus  after  The  Crash,  averaging  in  the  region  of  6  to  7  per  cent  a  year. Fiscal consolidation was well on track. Measured from the deficit peak  at  roughly  13  per  cent  in  2010  to  the  closure  of  the  gap  in  late  2012, Iceland had outpaced all other developed economies in terms of fiscal consolidation (Fitch Ratings, 2013), including Greece, where the consolidation  was  roughly  10  per  cent.  The  domestic  banking  sector  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":172,"content":"Rising from the Ruins – A Fragile Economic Recovery 163had  furthermore  been  quite  successfully  rebuilt.  The  new  banks  were  well liquated, fully capitalized and profitable. After extensive write-offs and  loan  restructuring,  non-performing  loans  had  been  reduced  from  18 per cent high in 2010 to well below 10 per cent.  In August 2011, Iceland completed the IMF programme when the fund approved  its  final  loan.  The  fund’s  representative,  Nemat  Shafik,  was  pleased  with  the  success  of  the  33-month  rescue  mission,  concluding  that strong policy implementation had ensured that key objectives were met, that public finances were on a sustainable path and the exchange rate had been stabilized and that the financial sector been restructured (quoted in International Monetary Fund, 2011).  Iceland was the first developed country to be downgraded leading up to  the  crisis,  starting  in  2006.  In  the  wake  of  The  Crash,  the  country  was  relegated  to  the  junk  bond  category.  Rating  rehabilitation  began  in  May  2011,  and  Iceland  was  back  to  investment  level  in  early  2012.  In February 2013, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s upgraded us further while many  other  countries  were  still  on  a  downward  trajectory  –  like  the  UK, which lost its triple-A rating. Fitch concluded that the new rating reflected Iceland’s ‘impressive progress in its recovery from the financial crisis of 2008–2009’ (Fitch Ratings, 2013). Moody’s concluded that with the help of the EFTA Court ruling in favour of Iceland over the Icesave dispute,  which  had  freed  it  from  potentially  large  costs,  the  Icelandic  economy  had  also  clearly  emerged  from  crisis-induced  recession  and  was now expanding at a reasonable pace. The key factor supporting the rating  was,  however,  Moody’s  view  that  ‘the  Icelandic  authorities  are  able and willing to pursue economic policies that allow the country to return to a sustainable economic, fiscal and external position within a reasonable period of time’ (Moody’s, 2013).  The  Fitch  report  further  stated  that  the  economy  was  growing,  that  fiscal consolidation remained on track and public debt was falling and, vitally, that the resolution of Icesave had ‘removed a material contingent liability  for  public  finances  and  brought  normalization  with  external  creditors’  (Fitch  Ratings,  2013).  In  the  report,  Iceland  was  viewed  less  at  risk  of  slipping  back  into  recession  than  some  troubled  Eurozone  countries.  Both  public  and  private  debt  had  slowly  but  surely  declined  since  shooting  up  after  the  crisis  hit.  This  too  was  partly  because  of  debt  restructuring and write-offs. The net international investment position reversed  after  the  Crash,  rising  to  a  negative  level  of  568  per  cent  by  end of 2011. This position was, however, distorted by the impact of the continuing  wind-up  proceedings  of  the  fallen  cross-border  banks.  The  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":173,"content":"164   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisfailed banks amounted to three-quarters of Iceland’s external debt, which would  evaporate  from  the  books  when  the  wind-up  was  completed.  With the completion of the winding-up process, Iceland’s external debt was  set  to  reduce  to  a  sustainable  level.  Landsbanki  was,  for  example,  expected to return all primary debt, including the entire principal of the Icesave accounts. Already in early 2013, more than half of the Icesave claims had been paid to the British and Dutch governments. Despite the EFTA Court ruling, the rest was to follow as the winding-up progressed. This was because of much better return out of the fallen banks than had been expected.  Sovereign  debt  was  also  on  a  downward  trajectory.  Since  peaking  way  above  a  year’s  GDP  in  2010,  public  debt  had  dropped  below  the  100 per cent mark. Holding the equivalent of more than 30 per cent of GDP  in  deposits  at  the  Central  Bank,  the  government  was  also  highly  liquid. This was enough to reduce net public debt to around 65 per cent, compared with roughly 80 per cent in Spain and almost 110 per cent in Ireland.  This  positive  outlook  was  mirrored  in  a  lower  CDS  spread;  in  2013 five-year Treasury bonds carried only 1.7 per cent, the lowest rate since mid-2008 (Central Bank of Iceland, 2013).  Another indication of a gradual rising from the ruins was found in the fact  that  emigration  had  stopped.  Unemployment  had  peaked  at  over  9  per  cent  in  2010,  up  from  only  1  per  cent  in  the  boom  years.  The  government then instigated several measures to create jobs and promote higher  work  market  participation,  for  example  subsidizing  salaries  for  companies  hiring  from  the  unemployment  registry.  By  early  2013,  unemployment had fallen below 5 per cent, for the first time since The Crash.  The  labour  marked  proved  quite  flexible.  It  helped  to  alleviate  the  pressure  caused  by  many  workers  leaving  the  country,  mostly  to  Norway. With a falling unemployment rate, the migration flow reversed in early 2013. By international standards, the activity rate in Iceland was high, above 80 per cent in 2013, averaging 44.1 hours per week.  Inflation, which always seems to strain our economy, remained stub-bornly high in the wake of the crisis, finally dropping below 4 per cent in early 2013, much later than expected. Despite prolonged difficulties in bringing inflation down, real wages had risen. Even the stock market, which had been wiped out in The Crash, was already in 2012 starting to recover. The index climbed 11 per cent in 2012, with an even sharper rise  in  early  2013  before  calming  again.  In  line  with  the  increasing  purchasing  power  of  disposable  income,  property  prices  were  also  on  the rise. For the first time since the crisis hit, building cranes could again be seen in Reykjavik in 2013.

Iceland became a fantastically popular tourist destination after The Crash. The drop in value of the currency certainly made the country cheaper but more vital was the unprecedented media attention  during  The  Crash,  which  put  Iceland  on  the  tourist  map.  When the Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted a couple of years later, shut-ting down European airspace for a full week as it spewed volcanic ash over the entire continent, the attention of the world was back. At first we  were  afraid  that  these  devastating  events  would  destroy  the  rest  of  our already tarnished reputation, but then we saw that they only made more people interested in travelling to Iceland. Their euros, pounds and dollars were very welcome.  By applying mixed measures rather than implementing strict austerity, the government was able to prevent rising inequality, as had occurred in many European countries and in America. In fact, inequality diminished in Iceland over the course of the crisis (Ólafsson & Kristjánsson, 2012). Iceland’s relatively rapid recovery compared with, for example Ireland, thus  perhaps  supported  Joseph  Stiglitz’s  claim  that  surging  inequality  was stifling recovery in America (Stiglitz, 2013).    Challenges ahead  When taking stock five years into the Credit Crunch, Iceland in many ways  showed  remarkable  progress.  Though  recovery  was  taking  root,  however, we still faced many grave challenges. The capital controls had certainly  helped  to  cushion  us  from  the  Eurozone  crisis,  but  they  had  also seriously distorted the domestic economy, for example promoting a seemingly unstable local asset price bubble. The controls also discour-aged much-needed foreign investment, to the point of prolonged diffi-culties. Over time, the side effects of capital controls can easily become worse  than  the  sickness  they  were  meant  to  cure.  Here,  the  national  postcolonial  identity  was  also  at  play.  Most  interest  for  foreign  direct  investment was in the field of energy. Our government had, though, in line with the nationwide suspicion of foreign investors, been hesitant in allowing external investment in land and in the energy sector. Examples of  such  suspicion  were  the  difficulties  the  Canadian  energy  company  Magma Energy faced when refused investment in a natural heat energy company and when Chinese investor Huang Nubo was refused permis-sion  to  buy  a  piece  of  privately  held  but  mostly  deserted  land  in  the  north of Iceland where he wanted to build a tourist resort. Criticisms of ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":175,"content":"166   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisthese planned investments aside, it was interesting in both instance that the main objection in the public discussion revolved around the foreign ownership  aspect  rather  than  whether  operations  like  these  should  be  privately owned or not.  Iceland’s main economic challenge was tackling the currency issue. An independent króna proved to have procyclical effects. Massive amounts of  krónas  looking  to  emigrate  put  immense  pressure  on  the  exchange  rate, which had already dropped by more than half. Solving the balance of payments problem, primarily the so-called  overhang , was pressing. The overhang  consisted  of  the  trapped  carry  trade  and  foreign-held  króna  assets of the fallen banks. In all, this amounted to more than €5 billion or  around  half  the  annual  economy  (Áskorun,  2013).  Though  a  third  of liquid assets in króna held by non-residents, mainly from the carry trade,  had  by  2013  been  eased  out  of  the  system  through  the  Central  Bank’s auction channels, krónas amounting to 23 per cent of GDP were still trapped (Fitch Ratings, 2013). This was excluding the króna assets of  the  creditors  of  the  old  banks  that  still  were  to  be  liquated  in  the  winding-up procedures. Allowing these krónas to leave could easily lead to another currency crisis. There was thus still a pressing need to control liquid offshore krónas, for example by anchoring them to longer matu-rity or releasing them at a reduced price.  Iceland was not a fully fledged currency control regime, but rather a capital control regime that limited certain classified capital transactions (Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Affairs,  2013).  These  controls  still  made  it  difficult  for  many  cross-border  companies  in  Iceland  to  grow  properly. One of the country’s largest IT companies, the much celebrated internet gaming developer CCP, was amongst those that were, as a result, contemplating moving their headquarters abroad (Scrutton, 2013).  The government had a strategy of gradually lifting the capital controls, conditioned on the rate of the currency holding. It was in our interest to securely evacuate these assets without devaluing the króna too much. The  creditors’  main  interest,  on  the  other  hand,  was  to  gain  access  to  their  foreign  currency  assets  linked  to  the  fallen  banks  abroad.  Under  Icelandic  law  these  assets  could  be  paid  out  in  krónas  and  thus  held  within  the  controlled  currency  regime.  This  is  something  most  credi-tors  wanted  to  avoid.  Negotiation  were  thus  under  way  to  allow  the  krónas to be exchanged for foreign currency and leave cross the controls over a prolonged period for significantly reduced value in exchange for liquidating the external assets in foreign currency. The more their value was reduced in terms of foreign currency, the faster the controls could ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":176,"content":"Rising from the Ruins – A Fragile Economic Recovery 167be  lifted.  The  Central  Bank’s  governor  hinted  at  around  a  75  per  cent  discount on the króna when leaving (quoted in Ægisson, 2013).  Solving  the  overhang,  however,  would  not  automatically  allow  the  lifting  capital  controls  –  when  Iceland  was  locked  behind  capital  controls  for  63  years,  between  1931  and  1994,  there  was  no  overhang  problem. In fact, there is a vicious cycle here, as the controls themselves can distort the economy to the extent that it is no longer fit for the free flow of capital.  Furthermore, the general outlook for Iceland’s recovery was linked to economic development in Europe, as three-quarters of our exports were to the continent, 60 per cent of which went to the Eurozone.    Conclusion  After  experiencing  one  of  the  most  profound  financial  crises  a  devel-oped  country  has  suffered,  Iceland  soon  began  to  show  signs  of  an  impressive recovery. The macro economy had stabilized, which perhaps was  best  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  there  was  no  longer  much  talk  of  the sovereign defaulting. Marginal growth, which started in the second quarter of 2010, was in 2013 set to continue, but on a lower pace. Fiscal consolidation was on track and public debt had been on a steady down-ward  trajectory  since  The  Crash.  Furthermore,  the  domestic  financial  system  was  quite  well  funded  and  resolution  of  the  Icesave  dispute  in  early  2013  normalized  relations  with  external  creditors  and  removed  potential further contingent liabilities for the state. Very much contrary to predictions when the crisis hit in 2008, it can thus be concluded that Iceland had performed better than for example the Eurozone countries.  The commonly held prediction that Iceland would suffer devastating damage to its reputation by not bailing out its banks and by not covering Icesave with interests was also proved utterly wrong. The contrary can actually be argued, as in the wake of the crisis Iceland was praised in the international  media  for  going  against  the  current  and  being  the  only  country refusing to dump the private debts of the banking system onto taxpayers’ shoulders. Though this picture is not entirely accurate, as has been established here, this positive change in media attitudes to Iceland served the economy well.  Most importantly, however, many structural aspects in the economy remained  favourable.  The  country’s  strong  production  base  was  still  intact as well as the countries highly lucrative natural resources. Many of our main international production companies had survived the storm ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":177,"content":"168   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisand were able to generate much needed foreign revenues. In addition, Iceland had a robust, young, well educated population and strong indus-trial  infrastructure.  We  were  thus  ready  and  able  to  take  on  a  greater  burden and move faster through the crisis than many less flexible and older populations.  The  outlook  was  thus  rather  positive,  but  fragile.  There  were  still  significant systemic risks to overcome. The debt burden of households and  small  businesses  was  still  much  too  high.  The  pressure  on  the  exchange  rate  was  such  that  lifting  capital  controls  was  not  in  sight,  which could result in prolonged difficulties, as capital controls gradually distort set the set-up of the domestic economy and, thus, create strong groups with interests in keeping them in place. A comprehensive agree-ment  with  creditors  to  leave  over  a  long  enough  period  and  at  a  low  enough exit rate also needed to be completed. And though most econo-mists did agree that the króna was too small and vulnerable to be set on completely free flow again, there was still no consensus domestically on a future monetary policy. This was perhaps the greatest systemic flaw to overcome before a more sustainable recovery could be reached.  In addition to alleviating pressure on the króna and solving the capital control problem, the main challenges were low growth, uncertainty as to  the  health  of  the  fragile  new  financial  sector,  low  investment  and  ongoing inflationary pressure. In addition to these challenges, prolonged difficulties in the Eurozone diminished the room for further growth in Iceland.  However,  though  the  recovery  remained  fragile,  the  outlook  was  for  continued  expansion,  declining  inflation  and  a  strengthened  external position.     ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":178,"content":"169   The Crash of 2008 not only was a severe financial crisis but also served a  devastating  blow  to  Icelandic  politics.  Key  government  institutions  stood  accused  of  having  sponsored  the  rise  and  collapse  of  the  failed  neoliberal  model.  This  was  a  crisis  of  capitalism,  which  opened  new  opportunities for political reform in addition to the economic recovery discussed in previous chapter. In the wake of the crisis and the following Pots and Pans Revolution, many initiatives were embarked upon to not only resurrect the failed model but also to implement more permanent changes to the political system. There was a clear popular call for polit-ical reform; a  New Iceland  was to emerge from the ruins. Many non-gov-ernmental groupings were founded, and they deliberated and promoted different avenues out of the crisis. Ordinary people not only took to the streets in protest in the wake of The Crash but also engaged much more actively  than  before  in  public  discussion  –  in  the  mainstream  media  as  well  as  on  blogs  and  through  social  media  outlets.  Many  called  for  the  establishment  of  Iceland’s  Second  Republic  or,  in  data  lingo,  the  updating of the system to Iceland 2.0.  Many  measures  were  taken  in  the  aftermath  of  The  Crash,  which  collectively  had  the  aim  of  widespread  political  reform.  Parliament  appointed  a  Special  Investigation  Commission  –  a  ‘truth  committee’  –  to  analyse  the  events  leading  up  to  The  Crash  and  estimate  whether  government ministers had been at fault. The government established a Special Prosecutor, who was to investigate criminal activity in the finan-cial sector leading up to The Crash. In order to regain access to interna-tional markets, the government agreed to cover the Icesave deposits and applied for EU membership, mainly to underpin its monetary policy by adopting the euro. Jointly these moves were aimed at securing Iceland’s       9   Reconstituting Iceland – and the New Critical Order   ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":179,"content":"170   Iceland and the International Financial Crisiseconomic framework for the future. The political party system was also being  challenged  not  only  by  widespread  leadership  renewal  within  the established parties but also by a flood of new parties emerging; for example, the Best Party, led by a well known comedian, took control of the capital city and becoming Mayor of Reykjavik in 2010. Calling for an extraordinary election for a Constitutional Assembly, which was to write a new constitution, was perhaps the most ambitious of these efforts for political reform.  However, as I will explain in this chapter, even as economic recovery was  taking  root,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  chapter,  most  of  these  initiatives  for  significant  political  reform  were  caught  in  what  can  be  described  as  a    new  critical  order ,  which  took  hold  in  post-crisis  Iceland  and, in effect, contradicted the many reparative moves.    Political accountability  The report of the Parliament-appointed Special Investigation Commission (SIC),  published  in  2010,  had  been  awaited  with  great  anticipation.  It  claimed leaving almost no stone unturned in its analysis of the lead-up to The Crash and ran to 2,700 pages in 9 volumes. The report concluded that three ministers had been criminally negligent: the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Commerce. The three gover-nors  of  the  Central  Bank  and  the  director  of  the  financial  supervisory  authority  were  also  found  to  be  at  fault.  The  main  conclusion  of  the  SIC’s Working Group on Ethics was that ‘the most important lessons to draw from these events are about weak social structures, political culture and public institutions’ (Árnason, Nordal & Ástgeirsdóttir, 2010).  One of the first tasks of the new left-wing government was to replace the  politically  appointed  leadership  of  the  Central  Bank  with  a  more  professional  management.  The  Bank’s  leading  governor,  former  PM  Davíð  Oddsson,  fought  tooth  and  nail  against  being  sacked  but  was  in  the  end  removed  by  a  new  law  changing  the  bank’s  management  structure came in to force. The significance of the move towards more professional  practices  was,  however,  somewhat  diminished  by  the  fact  that an economist with close ties to the Social Democratic Alliance, Már Guðmundsson, was appointed the bank’s single new governor.  On the back of the findings of the SIC, the new left-leaning Parliament decided  to  invoke  a  hitherto  dormant  clause  in  the  constitution  and  prosecute  former  PM  Geir  Haarde  before  a  special  court  that  could  be  called  to  hold  ministers  accountable  for  wrongdoing.  This  special  Country Court ( Landsdómur ) had never been convened before. Haarde ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":180,"content":"Reconstituting Iceland – and the New Critical Order 171faced many charges but was in the end sentenced only for neglecting to hold government meetings leading up to The Crash, when he should, according  to  the  Country  Court’s  interpretation  of  the  constitution,  have  kept  his  ministers  better  informed  of  the  critical  situation.  His  punishment was suspended, so in the end, this was only a slap on the wrist (Dómur Landsdóms, 2012). In addition, the fact that his political opponents had singled out only Haarde for prosecution undermined the whole exercise.    Criminal investigation  The office of Special Prosecutor set up to investigate criminal activity in the financial sector leading up to The Crash was seen as a vital instru-ment for holding those responsible for the devastating events account-able.  Both  the  public  at  large  and  many  politicians  were  keen  to  hold  bankers  accountable.  For  that  purpose,  the  famous  Norwegian/French  financial crime fighter, Eva Joly, was hired to advise the new institution. Over a hundred cases of suspected fraud had been opened, many quite large in scope (Act on the Office of a Special Prosecutor, 2008).  Many of the top management of the old banks were held in custody while under investigation but few sentences were passed. Amongst the most  high-profile  cases  was  an  accusation  of  fraud  against  Glitnir’s  former  CEO,  Lárus  Welding,  who  was  sentenced  to  nine  months  in  prison, but six of them were suspended. Another high-profile conviction was the two years prison meted out for insider trading to the Permanent Secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Baldur  Guðlaugsson,  who  had  belonged  to  the  Locomotive  group  discussed  in  Chapter  4.  Kaupthing  Bank’s top management and key owners were also prosecuted for wide-spread market manipulation in the previously discussed Al-Thani case.  Though it was hailed as the one of the ‘world’s most sweeping inves-tigations into the bankers whose action contributed to the global finan-cial crisis’ (Higgins, 2013), many in Iceland were still frustrated by the slow pace of the prosecution.    Re-entering international society  As discussed in Chapter 3, where I analysed Iceland’s foreign relations, the EU had been becoming more appealing to many Icelanders before The Crash and immediately afterwards.

The SDA hoped that the adoption of the euro would underpin the crisis-ridden economy and provide a more solid base for recovery than continuing to rely on the constantly devaluating króna.  Support for EU membership, however, rapidly declined as the Iceave dispute heightened. The EU was thought to be supporting its members, the  UK  and  Netherlands,  against  Iceland.  This  commonly  held  belief  was reinforced when the European Commission joined in with the EFTA Surveillance Authority in its case against Iceland before the EFTA Court. Soon, support for EU membership reversed, with polls showing fiercer opposition  against  membership  than  ever  before  (Samtök  Iðnaðarins,  2013). This led the government to slow down the accession negotiation process leading up to the May 2013 election and promising not to open any  new  chapters  in  the  negotiation.  After  the  election,  the  right-of-centre government formally put the accession negotiation on hold and in effect stopped the process.  In order to re-access international financial markets after The Crash, the post crisis left wing government saw it as a necessary evil to accept responsibility  for  the  Icesave  deposits.  This  proposal  was,  however,  firmly rejected by the Icelandic electorate in two referendums initiated by the President of the Republic, as was discussed in Chapter 7.    Challenging the party system  The Icelandic political party system traditionally consisted of four main parties, as discussed in Chapter 2; the Independence Party (IP), Iceland’s old  right-wing  hegemonic  power,  the  Progressive  Party  (PP)  which  is  based on traditional national sentiments with roots in agriculture, the rather  internationalist  and  left-of-centre  Social  Democratic  Alliance  (SDA)  and  the  further-left-leaning,  feminist  and  environmentalist  Left  Green  Movement  (LGM).  Alongside  the  four  main  parties  there  had  always been a fifth and sometimes a sixth ad hoc or shorter-term parties, often formed around specific issues. The longest standing of these was the Women’s List, which persisted during the 1980s and the 1990s.  Standing  accused  of  having  been  corrupted  in  the  boom  years,  the  conventional  parties  were  challenged  in  the  wake  of  The  Crash.  The  Progressive Party, with a completely renewed leadership, the old guard having been purged after leaving government in 2007, offered to back the ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":182,"content":"Reconstituting Iceland – and the New Critical Order 173left-wing minority government led by Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, the post-crisis leader of the SDA. The LGM had been in opposition in the boom years and thus was not seen as having been contaminated by the Viking economy. Forces emerging out of the Pots and Pans Revolution were able to fill the fifth party slot when the Citizens’ Movement won 4 of the 63 seats in Parliament in the 2009 election. More devastating for traditional politics, however, was the victory of the Best Party, which in 2010 won 35  per  cent  of  the  votes  in  the  Reykjavik  City  election  by  mocking  conventional  politics.  ‘All  kinds  of  everything  for  losers  and  fools’   1   was the party’s slogan. The party was led by comedian Jón Gnarr, who, together with a number of colleagues mostly from the Reykjavik under-ground  Punk  Rock  scene,  was  able  to  secure  control  of  the  city,  in  a  coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance.  Leading  up  to  the  2013  parliamentary  election,  a  record  number  of  parties,  13  in  total,  stood  in  the  country’s  six  constituencies.  The  Progressive  Party,  under  its  new  leadership,  emerged  as  the  winner,  grabbing a quarter of the vote. This is remarkable because the PP had for decades gradually seen diminished support and was rather expected to leave Icelandic politics, or to survive only as a symbol of times gone by. Then, spectacularly, the party surged in opinion polls immediately after the EFTA Court ruled in favour of Iceland in the Icesave dispute in late January 2013. The ruling gave credibility to the new PP leadership, which was the only of the four main parties that had remained firmly against giving in to the British and Dutch throughout the dispute. The PP  gained  further  popularity  by  promising  to  force  foreign  creditors,  which  they  systematically  referred  to  as  ‘vulture  funds’  (  hrægammas-jóðir ), to pay for a 20 per cent debt relief household loans. The money to pay for this one off debt relief was to be retrieved when the creditors would  be  allowed  to  leave  cross  the  controlled  currency  borders.  On  the back of its firm stance in the Icesave dispute and by promising to squeeze money out of foreign creditors, the PP more than doubled its support.  In the 2013 election, the SDA and LGM were heavily punished, mainly for  accepting  liability  in  the  Icesave  dispute  when  in  government.  In  fact,  the  SDA  suffered  the  greatest  loss  of  any  party  in  the  history  of  the republic. Interestingly, however, the previously hegemonic IP won only  a  few  more  votes  than  in  the  2009  election,  when  the  party  had  had its worst result in history. Down from its traditional level of almost 40  per  cent,  the  IP  now  received  only  roughly  a  quarter  of  the  votes.  Throughout  the  first  half  of  the  post-crisis  parliamentary  term,  the  IP  had consistently been polling around its traditional level. The descent ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":183,"content":"174   Iceland and the International Financial Crisishad  started  when  its  new  leadership  decided  to  back  the  last  Icesave  agreement in Parliament.  The volatility of Icelandic politics was perhaps best illustrated by the fact  that  two  new  parties  were  in  the  2013  election  able  to  pass  the  5  per cent threshold necessary to win seats in Parliament. Bright Future, which was created out of people from the Best Party and splinters of the SDA, won six seats and the Icelandic version of the international Pirate Party won four seats. This was the first time a Pirate Party had won seats in any national parliamentary election.  However,  even  though  a  record  number  of  the  electorate  voted  for  non-traditional  parties,  the  conventional  party  system  withstood  the  challenges waged against it. With the Citizens’ Movement dissolving in the 2013 election, the revolutionary forces from four years before were mostly gone.  It was an illustration of the IP’s weakened position in Icelandic politics that  after  the  election  it  had  to  settle  for  serving  under  the  PP  leader-ship  in  a  new  coalition,  despite  still  being  the  countries  largest  party,  with, however, only few more votes than the PP. In his first address on Iceland’s National Day, on 17 June 2013, Prime Minister Gunnlaugsson placed himself even more firmly than most of his predecessors within the  established  postcolonial  discourse,  mainly  emphasizing  Iceland’s  heritage  and  celebrating  the  nation’s  defiance  against  foreign  oppres-sion  in  the  Icesave  dispute.  Referring  to  the  IMF’s  concerns  over  the  new  government’s  debt  reduction  plan  for  households,  he  added  that  international  institutions  would  no  longer  dictate  Iceland’s  economic  policies (Gunnlaugsson, 2013).  In line with the persistence of the traditional political party system was the success of President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson in fending off challenger Þóra Arnórsdóttir in the 2012 presidential election. President Gímsson had lost credibility in the eyes of most Icelanders when standing accused of being the greatest cheerleader of the Viking Capitalists in the boom years.  Post-crisis,  however,  he  had  regained  popularity  when  referring  the Icesave agreements to referendums. These moves were nevertheless still controversial. His challenger, Þóra Arnórsdóttir, a young mother of five  and  a  non-controversial  TV  presenter,  ran  –  while  pregnant  –  on  a  ticket  calling  for  renewed  unity  and  an  end  to  crisis  politics.  But  by  referring to Arnórsdóttir’s adolescent involvement in pro-EU and social democratic politics, Grímsson was able to discredit his opponent and he gradually emerged as Iceland’s main post-crisis hero – mainly because of his firm stance against the British and Dutch in the Icesave dispute.

Similarly, constitutional revisions are usually only embarked upon in the aftermath of severe political or economic crisis (Elster, 1995). This is what can be called a constitutional moment. A constitutional moment emerges when a catastrophe mobi-lizes  societal  forces  for  fundamental  change  (Teubner,  2011).  In  the  wake of the crisis, Iceland came closer than most countries ever get to a  clean  slate  situation.  As  I  will  demonstrate,  the  constitutional  revi-sion  process  embarked  on  after  The  Crash  was  an  integral  part  of  the  ‘imagined recovery’ of Iceland from the most profound crisis to hit the republic since its creation in 1944. As a result, the process became highly politicized,  which  makes  it  a  interesting  case  to  study  the    new  critical  order , which emerged through the crisis and was contesting most of the initiatives for reform.  Pressured by the angry public, the new left-wing government decided in 2010 to start a constitutional review process, which would draft a new constitution in three phases. First a  National Forum  of a thousand people selected by stratified sampling were gathered for a one-day meeting to discuss what principles and values the new constitution should be based on. This was based on a civil movements initiative, called the Anthills, which the year before had held a similar event to map ideas for reform. A  seven-member  political  party-appointed    Constitutional  Committee  was  then  created  to  gather  information,  analyse  core  issues  discussed  by  the  National  Forum  and  propose  ideas  for  constitutional  revision.  Finally and most importantly, Parliament called for a national election of  an  independent,  25-member    Constitutional  Assembly ,  which  should  on the basis of the work of the National Forum and the Constitutional Committee  review  and  revise  Iceland’s  constitution  or  possibly  draft  a  completely new one.  The process was heavily politicized right from the beginning. The IP, recently  ousted  from  government,  fought  fiercely  against  it  every  step  of  the  way,  perhaps  feeling  that  the  whole  exercise  was  an  attack  on  their political heritage. Leading up to the spring 2009 election, the new leadership  of  the  PP  had  focused  their  strategy  for  regaining  trust  on  this  proposal  for  a  nationally  elected  Constitutional  Assembly,  which  they  insisted  would  serve  as  a  healing  process  to  reconstruct  Iceland’s  ‘Social Contract’, which had been ripped apart in The Crash.

While  the  new  PM,  Jóhanna  Sigurðardóttir,  and  many  of  her colleagues were eager supporters of the project, there was also quite hefty opposition amongst prominent ministers within the government. Many  parliamentarians  of  the  coalition  parties  either  remained  silent  or were suspected of only paying lip service to the project while quietly plotting against it.   Unfinished project  Constitutional  reform  had  been  on  the  agenda  of  Icelandic  politics  ever  since  the  republic  was  established  in  1944,  when  the  country  finally  came  out  from  under  Danish  rule  while  Denmark  was  still  under Nazi occupation. The celebrations were held in Parliamentary Fields (Þingvellir), the site of the medieval parliamentary court, which in  the  hundred-year-long  independence  struggle  had  become  the  holy  site  of  Iceland’s  national  spirit  (Hálfdanarson,  2001).  In  order  to  show  the  world  that  Icelanders  were  united  in  announcing  their  independence, in 1944 Parliament agreed not to make other changes to the constitution of the Icelandic kingdom than those directly stem-ming  from  the  establishment  of  the  republic  –  thus,  only  changing  the articles on the role of the Danish king to include references to a nationally elected Icelandic President. As a result, 95 per cent of the electorate agreed to establish the republic on the basis of the tempo-rary constitution that the king of Denmark had handed to us in 1874 on  the  thousandth  anniversary  of  Iceland’s  settlement,  which  had  until then been changed only marginally to provide for Home Rule in 1904 and Sovereignty status in 1918 (resulting in the 1920 constitu-tion  of  the  Icelandic  kingdom).  The  Union  Act  of  1918  contained  a  sunset  clause  stipulating  that  either  country  could  end  the  relation-ship after 25 years. The massive support for the 1944 constitution was thus due to the fact that a Yes vote was seen as the national duty of all Icelanders, but it was not necessarily an approval of the content of the constitution itself.  At the foundation of the republic in 1944, the founding fathers (they were  all  men)  had  announced  that  complete  constitutional  revision  would be instigated immediately (Jóhannesson, 2011). However, mostly because of political infighting, our parliamentarians were usually able to agree only on minor changes. When the process was jumpstarted after The Crash, constitutional revision was thus in many regards very much ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":186,"content":"Reconstituting Iceland – and the New Critical Order 177an unfinished project – perhaps even a thorn in the side of the young republic, as our parliamentarians were never able to agree on either the process of reform or the content of a new constitution. It was thus only in  the  wake  of  crisis  that  our  politicians  were  able  to  find  a  way  out  of the trenches of traditional party politics, outsourcing the drafting of a  new  constitution  to  a  nationally  elected  external  body.  The  primus  motor for that initiative was PM Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, who had been one of very few long-standing supporters of the call for such an external constitutional assembly.    Problems and participation  In all, 522 candidates stood for election to the Constitutional Assembly, marking unprecedented political involvement. Each had collected signa-tures  from  more  than  30  supporters,  which  collectively  amounted  to  almost 10 per cent of the entire population signing for one of the candi-dates. Only roughly 37 per cent of the electorate, however, participated in this unique election. In accordance with the nature of the assembly and perhaps because of the troubled political climate suspiciousness of party politics, the political parties did not field candidates and interest organizations refrained from intervening but instead supported certain individuals. Days before the election, however, the IP secretariat distrib-uted to its members a list of candidates that were considered ‘favourable’ to the party.  Twenty-five members from a broad background were elected, including a  few  of  those  the  IP  secretariat  had  listed  in  its  circular.  Among  the  elected were lawyers, artists, priests, professors, political scientists, media people,  erstwhile  MPs,  doctors,  company  board  member,  a  farmer,  a  campaigner  for  the  rights  of  handicapped  people,  mathematician,  a  nurse and a labour union leader. Soon after the results were announced, however, opponents of the process complained that only previously well known individuals had been elected, mostly from the ranks of the left-leaning  Reykjavik  elite.  In  fact,  though,  most  were  not  affiliated  with  any political party or party political association.  To  deal  with  the  complexity  of  the  voting  and  the  fact  that  voters  would  have  to  spend  much  more  time  in  the  ballot  booths  than  in  parliamentary elections, the electoral authorities decided to change the set-up, mainly by increasing the number of election booths. This proved to  carry  grave  consequences  when  the  election  was  announced  null  and  void  on  technical  grounds  (Meuwse,  2012).  This  was  an  extraor-dinary  decision,  which  almost  delivered  a  fatal  blow  to  the  whole  process.  The  ruling  was  criticized  for  ‘not  only  being  poorly  reasoned  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":187,"content":"178   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisbut  ...  also  materially  wrong’  (Axelsson,  2011).  Professor  Gylfason,  one  of the elected members, has indicated that the leading judge in the case, a  ‘staunch  party  man’  of  the  IP,  is  suspected  of  having  drafted  one  of  the complaints, which he then in his capacity as the judge leading the charge  ‘used  as  pretext  for  invalidating  the  election’  (Gylfason,  2012:  11). This, however, has not been proven.  Faced  with  this  unique  decision  –  the  first  general  national  election  in modern times to be invalidated, not only in Iceland but in the whole Western world, solely on trivial technical grounds, Parliament decided to simply appoint those individuals elected to the Constitutional Assembly to  a  Constitutional  Council,  which  would  more  or  less  have  the  same  tasks. This, however, severely damaged the legitimacy of the process.  It  was  thus  in  a  rather  awkward  situation  that  the  Constitutional  Council started its work in April 2011. The country had recently collapsed amid a financial crisis, the previous government had been ousted as a result  of  widespread  popular  protest  and  the  Council’s  own  mandate  had been called into question by the invalidation of the constitutional election.  The Council, working full time, was nested with a 700-page report from the  Constitutional  Committee  and  an  extensive  value  map  from  the  thousand-person National Forum. The message of the National Forum was  both  vast  and  far-reaching.  Among  its  main  demands  were  better  protection of human rights, the protection of Iceland’s sovereignty and language,  and  guarantees  that  the  nation’s  resources  remain  in  public  ownership.  The  Forum  also  agreed  that  each  vote  should  have  equal  weight and that representatives should be elected through preferential voting (The Main Conclusions of the National Forum, 2010).  Despite  members  holding  very  different  positions,  the  Council  was  able  to  unite  on  three  main  initial  tasks:  first,  to  update  the  human  rights chapter so that it incorporated social and civil rights and to add a  chapter  on  nature  protection  and  collective  ownership  of  common  natural resources; second, to divide more clearly the branches of govern-ment and third, to develop functional tools for increasing direct democ-racy,  for  example  with  preferential  voting  in  parliamentary  elections  and clear guidelines on how the people can call for referendums on vital issues.    ‘Crowdsourced’ constitution  Contrary to the advice of many constitutional experts, such as professor Jon  Elster,  the  Council  decided  to  open  its  work  up  to  the  public  as  much  as  possible.  This  interactive  engagement  with  the  public  was  at  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":188,"content":"Reconstituting Iceland – and the New Critical Order 179the expense of the more typical professional distance. The whole process had  been  heavily  politicized  in  a  harsh  exchange  between  politicians.  The  Council  believed  that  it  might  help  it  to  regain  legitimacy  in  the  eyes of the public to invite all those interested to participate.  Opinion  polls  indicated  that  popular  trust  of  Parliament  was  at  a  historic  low,  with  only  one  in  ten  feeling  content  with  its  work.  Professor  Jón  Ólafsson  claims  that  the  Council  in  fact  made  a  point  of  distancing  itself  from  Parliament  and  that  some  of  its  members  ‘expressed  openly  their  hostility  to  the  “political  elites”.’  He  claims  that the members saw themselves as representing the common public rather  than  the  privilege  elite,  and  that  as  a  result  of  the  widespread  anti-establishment  rhetoric  the  Council  ‘alienated  itself  from  the  Parliament’ (Ólafsson, 2012).  Through social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter, the Council attracted several thousand inputs in addition to 370 proposals via more traditional correspondence. The Council also opened up its meetings and working documents online. Viewing it from a distance, the international media was branding the production as the world’s first ‘crowdsourced’ constitution, drafted by the interested public in clear view of the world. The Council welcomed this focus and even played on it and used it to its  advantage  in  domestic  politics.  This  was,  however,  never  a  realistic  description of the drafting. Despite the open access and the existence of a robust secretariat staffed with many experts to assist the Council, the Council was not able to systematically plough through all the extensive input,  as  it  only  had  four  months  to  complete  its  task.   2    Many  in  the  international  media,  including  the    International  Herald  Tribune ,  never-theless reported that enthusiasts of open government around the world were insisting that the Icelandic constitutional process should serve as model for ordinary people to wrest power from the political elites that have monopolized political decision making (Morris, 2012).  Professor Jón Ólafsson (2012) claims that the Council in effect worked without a clear methodology as to the approach to the main principles of its work. However, rather than developing the document in a traditional linear fashion, the Council had decided to apply the  agile  method often used  in  software  development,  gradually  completing  a  holistic  docu-ment  in  several  rounds.  Each  week,  the  Council  posted  on  its  website  new provisional articles for perusal by the public. When comments and suggestions had been received from the public as well as from experts, the Council posted revised versions of the articles on its website. In this manner, the document was gradually refined and the final version of the new constitution arrived at. Despite initially wide differences in opinion ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":189,"content":"180   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisand on occasion vigorous open disputes, the Council adopted the new constitution  unanimously.  The  emphasis  on  solidarity  and  unanimity  grew  stronger  among  the  members  as  their  work  progressed,  precisely  because it was viewed as being vital in order for the Council to present a unified front against expected political resistance.  Scholars   in   the   Comparative   Constitutions   Project   at   Chicago   University, who analysed the draft, claimed that this constitution-making process was tremendously innovative and participatory and concluded that it would be at ‘the cutting edge of ensuring public participation in on-going governance,’ (Elkins, Ginsburg, & Melton, 2012).    New, not only amended  Amongst the Council’s main challenges was that the mechanics of the existing  constitution,  which  was  based  on  the  Danish  19  th -century governmental model, no longer mirrored the democratic governmental system  in  the  country.  Since  independence  in  1944,  a  comprehensive  constitutional debate had mostly been missing, fostering an ever-larger list of constitutional problems.  The 1944 constitution, for example, attributed a range of governmental duties and powers to Iceland’s largely ceremonial President – for example to appoint ministers, suspend Parliament, negotiate treaties with other states, and even exempt people from specific laws. After attributing all of  these  and  many  other  powers  to  the  President  of  the  republic,  the  constitution  whisked  them  back  in  two  articles,  which  stated  that  the  Presidents transferred his power to government ministers and was not responsible  for  governmental  decisions.  This  had  left  an  ambiguity  as  to  the  proper  role  of  the  President  and  even  as  to  the  nature  of  our  governmental  system.  Traditionally,  the  President  had  operated  as  a  ceremonial head of state but not as head of the government. As in other parliamentary democracies, the Prime Minister was the head of govern-ment. Iceland had therefore been classified as a Parliamentary Republic, like Ireland, Italy and Germany. However, in recent years, some scholars had been reinterpreting the constitution as describing a semi-presiden-tial system (e.g. Kristjánsson, 2012). President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, first  elected  into  office  in  1996,  had  gradually  been  merging  into  that  interpretation.  In  the  2012  presidential  election,  candidates  could  not  even  agree  on  the  role  of  the  President  or  the  nature  of  the  govern-mental  system  (Bergmann,  2012).  Despite  the  constitution’s  claiming  that  governmental  power  could  not  be  transferred  abroad,  because  of  the ambiguity in the 19th-century text Iceland was able to enter into the European Economic Area agreement, which, as explained in Chapter 3, ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":190,"content":"Reconstituting Iceland – and the New Critical Order 181had brought the country into the EU Single Market in exchange for its implementing all relevant EU laws.  The  1944  constitution  was  full  of  misconceptions  like  these,  which  had  resulted  in  ambiguous  and  often  contradictory  interpretations  of  the  text.  The  Council  understood  that  the  greatest  danger  of  the  old  constitution was that the blurred lines between branches of government made it possible for strong leaders to gradually gain control of all three branches  of  government  –  the  executive,  the  legislative  and  even  the  judiciary,  through  political  appointments  to  the  bench.  The  Council  therefore  came  to  the  conclusion  that  it  would  be  impossible  to  keep  the old constitutional model for a Western republic of the 21st century, which would be like basing a new space shuttle design on the architec-ture of a horse-drawn cart.  The  1944  constitution  had  allowed  the  executive  to  assume  power  from  the  legislature  and  the  courts.  Through  the  decades,  leaders  of  coalition  governments  had  gained  almost  complete  control  of  the  Parliament.  This  had  been  illustrated  when  the  leaders  of  the  IP  and  the  PP  (Prime  Minister  Davíð  Oddsson  and  Foreign  Minister  Halldór  Ásgrímsson) had decided without consulting Parliament or any of their colleagues to support the US by listing Iceland in the ‘coalition of the willing’ before the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Another example is found in the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court. The justice ministers of the same parties (IP and PP) had throughout the decades appointed the  vast  majority  of  all  new  judges.  Under  the  proposed  constitution,  Parliament would be more independent from the government and the misleading articles on the purely formal power of the President removed or moved to appropriate sections.  The  proposed  constitution  furthermore  explicitly  stipulated  that  natural resources are in the collective property of the nation. This is key to understand the harsh political debate over the constitutional reform process and the politicization of the whole project. The dispute over the ITQ  system,  has  has  been  branded  ‘The  battle  of  Iceland’.  Over  more  than three decades, control of Iceland’s fishing quota had amounted to the greatest political dispute in the country. For years, there had been a clear majority in opinion polls for rolling back the fishing quota virtu-ally given away in the 1980s. However, despite massive public support, an  article  acknowledging  the  public  ownership  of  the  fish  stock  had  not previously been added to the constitution. The IP, which has close links  with  the  Association  of  Fishing  Vessel  Owners  (LÍU),  had  always  stood  against  such  an  amendment.  This  might  partly  explain  the  IP’s  opposition to the project.  ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":191,"content":"182   Iceland and the International Financial Crisis  A healing process or a pet project?  By mid 2011Council members had reached a consensus on a draft consti-tution. This came as a surprise to many, including Parliament, which had no set plan on how to proceed. Professor Ólafsson (2012) claims that the main reason for the cool reception of the draft in Parliament was that the Council had refused to cooperate with Parliament or political parties on the drafting; that the politicians and the political elite therefore felt alienated from the draft.  No sooner had the draft been handed over than the traditional polit-ical quarrel started – perhaps not surprisingly, as throughout the process the establishment of the IP had fought tooth and nail against the entire project.  Holding  an  extremely  fragile  and  even  fluctuating  majority  (several MPs crossed lines in both directions during the term), the coali-tion government spent a full year navigating the draft through parlia-mentary procedures.  Finally,   Parliament   settled   on   holding   an   ‘advisory   referendum   on  20  October  2012.  Around  half  of  the  electorate  turned  out  for  the  referendum,  of  which  two-thirds  accepted  the  draft  as  the  basis  of  a  new  constitution,  which  Parliament  was  to  complete  (Niðurstöðum  þjóðaratkvæðagreiðslunnar   lýst,   2012).   The   overwhelming   support   for  the  proposal  came  to  the  surprise  of  many.  The  fate  of  the  whole  exercise was, however, still in the hands of Parliament. Running out of time leading up to the April 2013 election, the government reached an agreement to delegate the decision on the bill for a new constitution to the  next  Parliament.  Further  changes  to  the  bill  were  required  by  the  new  Parliament,  which  appointed  a  new  parliamentary  constitutional  committee to navigate through the complexities the process was caught in.  The  new  right-of-centre  government  however  had  no  intention  of  ratifying the draft constitution.  Repeatedly,  the  process  was  hijacked  by  party  political  infighting.  From the outset, many criticized the whole exercise for being only a pet project of Prime Minister Sigurðardóttir, even an unwelcome distraction from dealing with serious economic reform, which was of much more vital interest to the public. Caught in the new critical order of Iceland’s post-crisis politics, the constitutional process, like many other proposals for political reform, ran into trouble. Still, and perhaps somewhat para-doxically, the public discussion spurred by the project served as a healing process for the society after The Crash. Through it many had been able to contribute to the promise of a resurrected and reformed Iceland. The exercise as such is thus likely to have contributed to the expectation of greater public participation in decision making in the future.   ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":192,"content":"Reconstituting Iceland – and the New Critical Order 183  Conclusion  Five years after The Crash fragile economic reform was taking root. Many ambitious proposals and initiatives for widespread political reform had, however, been caught in what can be described as a new critical order taking  hold  in  the  Icelandic  post-crisis  society,  which  was  marked  by  political infighting. The post-crisis left-wing government thus failed in its quest to create a  New Iceland , which was to develop from the ruins. Though former PM Haarde was, in a controversial move, sentenced to imprisonment  for  not  holding  enough  government  meetings  leading  up  to  The  Crash,  politicians  were  not  really  being  held  accountable  for  the  devastating  events.  Admittedly,  some  of  the  bankers  respon-sible  for  the  crisis  were  investigated  and  some  sentences  were  passed,  but  for  the  most  part,  those  involved  were  still  able  to  embark  upon  new business adventures. Meanwhile, the government was not able to push the Icesave agreement through referendums and opposition grew against EU membership, ultimately bringing the accession negotiations to  a  halt.  The  constitutional  process  was  also  caught  in  the  political  infighting  characterizing  the  new  critical  order  as  most  proposals  for  reform were discredited.  Interestingly, the Icesave dispute was to dictate political development in  the  post-crisis  period,  rather  than  the  settling  of  scores  with  those  responsible for The Crash. After winning a landslide victory in the 2009 election  immediately  after  The  Crash,  the  two  left-wing  government  parties were heavily punished in the 2013 election. Their support started to  deteriorate  when  they  pushed  the  first  Icesave  agreement  with  the  UK and Holland through Parliament in late 2009. After the IP decided to support the left-wing government’s second Icesave agreement in late 2011, its support also started to fall, while the PP, which was the only party always vigorously campaigning against any agreement, surged in the polls when the EFTA Court in early 2013 cleared Iceland of wrong-doing. Only by applying postcolonial analysis can these phenomena be explained, as was discussed in Chapter 1 and will be analysed further in the short conclusion to this book, which I turn to next.

In early 2008, its three oversized cross-border banks, amounting to 85 per cent of the island’s financial  system,  fell  in  three  consecutive  days,  leaving  the  country  in  economic  devastation.  In  the  preceding  years,  the  financial  system  had  grow  to  nine  times  GDP,  to  become  the  crown  jewel  in  what  was  commonly phrased the Icelandic economic miracle. This was the Nordic Tiger’s  last  roar.  The  equity  market  was  wiped  out,  the  króna  tanked,  inflation  spiked  and  unemployment  rose  to  unprecedented  levels.  Abroad, Iceland’s reputation was in ruin. Collectively, these events have simply been branded  The Crash .  Devastating as this certainly was to our economy, it was also a crisis of politics  and  political  culture.  The  rise  of  high-level  cross-border  finan-cial services and the far-reaching  outvasion  in the new millennium had marked our entrance onto the world stage. The  Icelandic Project –  to be internationally recognized, as an independent state on an equal footing with others in the West – seemed to have been completed. Now it was in tatters. The Crash thus delivered a severe blow to our national iden-tity. It was thus a profound psychological shock as well as an economic debacle.  The severity of the Icelandic Crash makes for an exceptional case to study in this international financial crisis. Initially, the Icelandic banking collapse was collectively estimated to amount to the third-largest bank-ruptcy in world history. In terms of the country’s size, it was perhaps the greatest national crisis of them all. Still, five years later, fragile economic recovery  was  taking  root  though  a  prolonged  new  critical  order  had  halted much sustained political reform.      Conclusions and Final Remarks   ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":194,"content":"Conclusions and Final Remarks 185 The Icelandic crisis stands out in many ways. Instead of bailing out its privately held financial firms, as most governments tried to do – often at  great  cost  –  the  Icelandic  government  took  its  cross-border  banks  into  administration  and  split  them  into  old  ‘bad’  international  banks,  which  were  put  into  wind-up  procedures,  and  new  ‘good’  domestic  banks, which were created out of the fallen ones. This, however, did not free  Icelanders  from  shouldering  fiscal  cost  as  sovereign  debt  shot  up  from around 30 per cent of GDP to almost 100 per cent of GDP. In fact, Iceland suffered the second-greatest direct cost in this crisis, after only Ireland, which towered far above others on the list.  Icelanders’ response to the crisis also set the situation worlds apart from others. The Icelandic Crash was much more sudden than elsewhere. The whole world was watching when the country collapsed on live TV. This was a much greater shock than a gradual disintegration, like those in the PIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain), which saw public debt grow much more steadily. As Europe fell into recession, strict austerity measures  slowed  its  economy  even  further,  causing  more  prolonged  public hardship in the PIIGS, where there was, for example, lower labour market participation. After the ousting of the accross-the-centre grand coalition  in  the  so-called  Pots  and  Pans  Revolution  in  January  2009,  the  post-crisis  left-wing  government  initiated  various  complementary  measures  to  ease  the  crisis  rather  than  implementing  strict  austerity.  This  prevented  inequality  from  surging  as  it  did  in  many  other  coun-tries, cushioning the drop in purchasing power of lower income groups. The  evidence  from  the  Icelandic  case  thus  perhaps  supports  Joseph  Stiglitz’s (2013) argumentation in his dispute with Paul Krugman (2013) over the effect of inequality on recovery and growth. By preventing the purchasing power of the middle class from dropping too far, domestic consumption became one of the main motors generating growth again. Vital for recovery was, however, that the production base in fishing and other manufacturing industries remained intact, and many production companies still held a strong international marketing position.  The turnaround came in late 2010 with marginal growth after steep contraction.  International  financial  markets  were  re-accessed  in  2011,  when the Central Bank was able to auction a $1 billion bond for a decent rate. In late 2012, the rating institutions recognized Iceland’s recovery as  ‘remarkable’  and  lifted  our  bonds  back  to  investment  level.

The tiny economy still faced  grave  challenges.  Household  debt,  for  example,  was  still  beyond  a sustainable level and pressure on the króna was such that the lifting of capital controls was not yet in sight, with the accompanying danger of serious distortion in the set-up of the economy. In combination with the  prolonged  economic  difficulties  in  Europe,  Iceland’s  main  export  market, these challenges would further slow growth.  Iceland  was  rushed  into  rapid  modernization  in  the  20th  century.  Though  average  annual  growth  was  at  2.6  per  cent  throughout  the  century, the economy was characterized by repeated cycles of boom and bust.  The  saga  of  the  troubled  Íslandsbanki  in  the  early  20th  century  relates  in  an  interesting  way  to  the  devastating  events  suffered  in  the  early  21st  century,  when  our  oversized  cross-border  banks  collapsed.  When the foreign-owned Íslandsbanki was established in 1904, capital came  pouring  into  a  closed  off  and  backward  economy,  which  was  thirsty  for  liquidity  from  abroad.  Icelanders  bought  engines  for  their  primitive trawlers, creating the beginnings of a fishing-based economy. The fish could be sold abroad and soon Iceland was awash with foreign cash. Holding a central banking licence, with a firm peg to the Danish krona,  Íslandsbanki  prompted  the  trans-nationalization  of  Icelandic  capital accumulation and the early, fragile financialization of the society. When it ran into trouble, the cross-border Íslandsbanki was refused help and allowed to default, while the central banking licence was moved to the domestic Landsbanki, which was saved. Capital controls were intro-duced in 1931, locking Iceland out of international capital markets for 63 years – until it entered the EEA agreement in 1994.  The next wave of foreign cash came in the Second World War, when the British and American armies landed in Reykjavik. Enjoying generous funding from the Marshall Aid plan, Iceland was able to invest in high-tech fishing vessels, and because of its new geostrategic importance in the Cold War, it was able to expand its fishing ground in the so-called Cod  Wars  and  push  the  British  out  of  its  waters.  During  the  decades  immediately  after  independence  from  Denmark  in  1944,  Iceland’s  economy thus continued to be characterized by extensive accumulation based on fishing, which became the engine room of our economy. This created  a  new  historical  bloc  around  fishing  exports  with  close  ties  to  the hegemonic Independence Party. Foreign currency was now pouring into the country, increasing inflation, which rose to unsustainable levels in  the  troubled  1970s.  A  generational  shift  within  the  IP  leading  to  a  neoliberal accumulation strategy occurred in the following decade.

These  repeated  cycles  of  boom  and  bust  spurred  an  increased  effort  towards diversification, leading for example to widespread use of natural energy, mostly for aluminium production. This collective move towards diversification in turn led to an emphasis on high-tech industry in the 1990s and financial services in the first decade of the new century, both of which were to suffer devastating blows.  The  procyclycality  of  governmental  economic  policies  was  only  to  grow further, leading to perhaps the greatest national economic collapse in  the  present  financial  crisis.  Iceland’s  new  finance-driven  economy  had  taken  shape  around  the  turn  of  the  century,  replacing  the  old  resource-based  growth  model.  This  change  was  also  facilitated  by  the  neo-corporatist  agreement  in  1990.  The  so-called  National  Concensus  Agreementy  linked  interest  of  the  labour  movement  with  that  of  the  financial  sector  through  operating  accumulative  pension  funds  which  invested heavily on capital markets. This removed a potentially signifi-cant source of opposition to further financialization.  After a prolonged drought, Iceland was again thirsty for foreign money. By  accessing  the  Single  European  Market  in  1994  and  subsequently  privatizing the state-owned domestic banks, Iceland was rushed towards a neoliberal, finance-driven economy: Icelandic Viking Capitalism was born. The much celebrated outvasion was considered necessary to break the  constraints  of  smallness  that  were  holding  back  growth.  Further  growth was viewed as necessary to broaden the base of the economy in order to ensure its economic independence. It can thus be argued that Iceland was too small for its own national identity.  Thanks  to  a  neoliberal  deregulation  strategy,  Iceland  moved  in  one  decade  from  being  amongst  the  most  heavily  regulated  and  backward  banking  regimes  to  being  one  of  the  most  liberal  in  the  world.  Three  banking conglomerates emerged out of the almost simultaneous priva-tization,  deregulation  and  internationalization  of  the  economy,  each  entrenched  in  its  own  power  networks.  Hailed  as  a  new  breed  of  bril-liant businessmen, the competing groups flocked en masse onto inter-national markets, embarking on one of the grandest shopping sprees in world history – collectively termed the Icelandic  outvasion .  The  expansion  was  not  entirely  self-driven.  Rather,  it  was  also  a  result  of  procyclycal  governmental  policies.  In  addition  to  the  previ-ously mentioned policy changes came increased public housing loans, massive   new   industrial   construction,   far-reaching   tax   cuts   and   a   ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":197,"content":"188   Iceland and the International Financial Crisisreduction in banks’ reserve requirements. This only blew more hot air into the overinflated bubble, until the economy imploded. The Central Bank’s  sole  response,  hiking  interest  rates  to  counter  the  rising  infla-tion,  only  attracted  more  hot  money,  which  came  pouring  in  as  the  carry  trade  looked  to  exploit  the  vast  interest  rate  difference.  To  add  to all this was the risk-seeking behaviour of private corporations, with diminished cushions against risk while operating in increasingly inter-connected banks and condensed groups of corporations. The Icelandic political economy had become incestuous.  Several  macroeconomic  imbalances  thus  grew  in  the  boom  years,  leaving  the  economy  ever  more  vulnerable.  Nothing  was,  however,  done to counter the procyclycality. Corporate and household debt built to  staggering  levels,  private  consumption  surged,  house  prices  rock-eted and shares multiplied in value. Ordinary people were turned into venture capitalists in a far-reaching financialization of the society. Banks’ balance sheets were over-extended and the current account deficit grew unsustainable.  When  the  crisis  hit,  these  imbalances  would  take  long  time to reverse.  When analysing these policies and events, we cannot ignore Iceland’s national  identity,  carved  out  in  the  struggle  for  independence  from  Denmark  in  the  19th  and  early  20th  centuries.  The  national  myth  indeed  laid  the  foundation  on  which  the  Icelandic  republic  still  rests.  Importantly,  the  struggle  did  not  end  when  full  independence  was  won.  The  year  1944  rather  marks  the  start  of  Iceland’s  new    everlasting  independence  struggle.  The  fragility  of  Iceland’s  sovereignty  is  always  present, with constant threats to the very existence of the nation.  The  postcolonial  national  identity,  which  is  based  on  a  commonly  held national myth of our history, puts emphasis on  formal  sovereignty and insistence on being recognized as an equal partner in Europe, rather than a microstate that relies on a larger neighbour. This is what can be called  the    Icelandic  Project .  The  duality  of  the  national  identity  often  creates tension between emphasis on  internal  independence and  external  recognition – between  isolationist  and  internationalist  approaches.  The  colonial  experience  is  still  very  present  in  contemporary  poli-tics, in terms of both rhetoric and praxis. In line with the poststructural emphasis in IPE, I thus maintain that Iceland’s colonial past and post-colonial relations still decisively impact on Iceland’s political economy. To contextualize contemporary Iceland, our historically based national memory has to be taken into account. Indeed, the discursive representa-tion of the past is continually present in Icelandic politics, and contem-","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":198,"content":"Conclusions and Final Remarks 189porary interpretations of the state of the economy stand in a dynamic relationship with a common notion of our past.  It  is  thus  also  in  this  light  that  these  procyclical  policies  need  to  be  examined.  The  economic  development  throughout  the  20th  century,  and  especially  in  the  boom  years  in  the  new  millennium,  served  to  underpin Iceland’s  internal  economic independence and  external  recog-nition as a modern state at least equal to others.  The  effect  of  the  postcolonial  identity  is  perhaps  most  evident  in  Iceland’s  foreign  relations.  Participating  fully  in  the  Single  European  Market through the EEA serves our insistence on being economically on an equal footing with others, while formally staying out of EU institu-tions supports our notion of formal sovereignty. In fact, Iceland’s rela-tionship  with  the  EU  only  makes  sense  when  taking  into  account  its  colonial  history  and  postcolonial  national  identity,  which  emphasize  formal sovereignty. It has since become the core of the Icelandic polit-ical  identity  to  guard  formal  sovereignty.  This  neither-in-nor-out  situ-ation was, however, costly when the crisis hit and Iceland found itself vulnerable and quite alone in the world.  The  desire  for  modernization  and  external  recognition  as  an  inde-pendent equal partner – Iceland’s postcolonial national identity – can help  to  explain  the  sudden  and  often  uncritical  implementation  of  procyclycal  economic  policies,  especially  in  the  boom  years  leading  up to The Crash. Iceland was in a hurry to modernize and grow. These sentiments  can  also  help  to  explain  some  of  the  seemingly  irrespon-sible behaviour of the Viking Capitalists, which did not always seem to be based on purely business decisions – some of the trophy invest-ments in Copenhagen, for example, which perhaps rather served as a statement  that  Icelanders  were  no  longer  a  ‘poor  nation’  subjugated  to Denmark, but a modernized equal player in the world of business. After all, they too were children of the Icelandic postcolonial national identity.  This  desire  for  external  recognition  helps  not  only  to  explain  the  boom but also to understand the defiant response foreign critics of the Icelandic  finance-driven  Viking  economy  faced  in  the  mini-crisis  of  2006.  The  criticism  directly  countered  our  postcolonial  national  iden-tity,  which  can  explain  why  such  words  of  caution  were  almost  cate-gorically  dismissed  as  the  ill-willed  interference  of  foreign  oppressors.  We  were  living  in  a  financial  fairytale  told  through  thick  nationalistic  rhetoric.  The  anxiety  many  Icelanders  felt  over  the  misrepresentation  abroad after The Crash derives from the same origin. ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":199,"content":"190   Iceland and the International Financial Crisis Interestingly,  the  national  rhetoric  has  survived  all  these  twists  and  turns.  During  the    boom ,  the  emphasis  was  on  the  uniqueness  of  the  Icelandic  nation,  which  was  almost  destined  for  greatness;  during  the    bust ,  the  emphasis  was  on  defying  foreign  oppression  once  again;  and when  recovery  was taking hold, Icelanders started to insist on their special achievements in dealing with the crisis – as was articulated by our President after the first referendum on Icesave, when he compared them with the democratic innovations of ancient Greece. Thus, a mixture of neoliberal  ideology  and  our  postcolonial  national  sentiments  can,  at  least partly, explain The Crash.  The Crash, however, not only threatened the viability of the Icelandic Project  but  also  opened  up  new  space  to  re-examine  its  foundation.  Many initiatives were taken to create what was to be become a reformed Iceland.  Our  politicians  were  to  be  held  accountable  for  their  failures  leading up to The Crash and the bankers were to be punished for crim-inal activity. Iceland was to normalize foreign relations by negotiating an agreement over Icesave and then enter into the European Union to underpin  a  more  stable  economy  by  also  entering  the  Eurozone.  The  political  party  system,  which  had  been  accused  of  being  corrupt,  was  challenged and the people were to bypass Parliament and directly elect their representatives to write a new constitution. However, as discussed in Chapter 9, these initiatives have not materialized in significant polit-ical  change.  The  Icelandic  postcolonial  project  has  for  the  most  part  survived the crisis without being significantly altered.  The  Icelandic  crisis,  though,  still  significantly  differs  from  events  in  many other crisis-ridden European countries, notably the PIIGS. Iceland and  Ireland  provide  for  an  especially  interesting  comparison.  Both  lagged behind the rest of Europe in economic development throughout the  20th  century.  Both  then  enjoyed  a  rapid,  finance-driven  boom,  which resulted in a housing and asset bubble, which burst near the end of the first decade of the new millennium. Ireland, a member of the EU and  the  EMU,  issued  a  blanket  guarantee  for  its  banks’  liability  while  Iceland, an EEA participant with the smallest independent currency in the world, was forced to take its banks into administration. Iceland has more  in  common  with  Ireland  than  with  Portugal,  Italy,  Greece  and  Spain, which have mostly suffered a debt crisis. Interestingly, neoliberal financialization started in Iceland and in Ireland in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as well as in Greece. The Irish and the Icelandic crises derive from  their  oversized  banking  systems.  Both  landed  in  an  IMF  rescue  programme. The EU and the ECB backed Ireland while Iceland’s emer-gency money came from the Nordics and Poland. Unlike Iceland, which ","fileName":"book.pdf"},{"page":200,"content":"Conclusions and Final Remarks 191suffered  a  blow  to  purchasing  power  when  the  currency  plummeted  and  housing  debts  peaked,  Ireland  was  able  to  maintain  much  greater  stability in living standards. However, it can be argued that socializing private  debt  slowed  down  growth  in  Ireland  in  the  wake  of  the  crisis,  with the economy slowly suffocating. Iceland was, on the other hand, much faster in generating growth again, but after a much more profound crisis initially.  Iceland’s blessing in disguise was that we did not enjoy access to more money  leading  up  to  and  during  The  Crash.  If  Iceland  had  been  able  to guarantee the banks’ liabilities in the same manner as the Irish, our public debt might have been doubled. Iceland thus accidentally stum-bled upon the novel path of not bailing out its banks; until then, it was a  commonly  held  belief  that  banks  should  not  be  allowed  to  fail  in  a  modern Western economy. In Iceland’s case, however, they proved too big to rescue.  Being  at  the  centre  of  international  media  attention  was  new  to  Icelanders, who often felt frustrated by misreporting. The outside world had little knowledge of the island’s internal intrigues and nuances and was prone to make little distinction between bankers, the state and the public. Rather,  Iceland  as a whole was reported to have collectively acted in certain ways. Three main stories were told in the international media about the Icelandic crisis: first, when the crisis hit, that Iceland would be in economic ruin for decades to come; second, in the wake of the Pots and Pans Revolution and the ousting of the government, that the public had sent the bankers to prison while writing their own constitution in a radical revolution; and third, after the 2013 Parliamentary election, that Icelanders had voted back into power those responsible for the crisis. As has been documented here, none of these three commonly told tales is true. As has been discussed at length in this book, the reality of the situ-ation is much more ambiguous.  The  parliamentary  election  in  spring  2013  that  resulted  in  a  new  right-of-centre coalition, replacing the post-crisis left-wing government, marked  a  paradigm  shift  away  from  crisis  politics  and  the  continuity  of traditional procyclycal economic policies. Promising widespread debt relief  to  ordinary  households  and  cutting  taxes  while  sponsoring  new  manufacturing plants in rural areas and simultaneously lowering leasing costs to the fishermen perhaps marked the start of a new economic cycle of boom and bust, which still characterizes Iceland’s economy.
